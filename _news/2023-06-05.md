Changelog:

* Changes to the [downloadable EPUB ebook]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/epub/the_magnus_archives.epub):

    - Added a cover page.

    - Fixed broken links on a couple of pages.

    - Changed title page to make it more obvious that the ebook is unofficial and was generated by someone ostensibly named "snarp".

    - Removed TRQ summaries from chapter headers.

    - Minor changes to make EPUB formatting align better with website formatting.

* Fixed minor typos/misheard dialog in episodes:

    - [MAG056 Children of the Night]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/056.html)

    - [MAG065 Binary]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/065.html)

    - [MAG117 Testament]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/117.html)

    - [MAG127 Remains to be Seen]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/127.html)

* With apologies to [tmatranscripts](https://tmatranscripts.tumblr.com/), removed potentially-confusing meme reference in [MAG140 The Movement of the Heavens]({{site.baseurl}}/episode/140.html):
