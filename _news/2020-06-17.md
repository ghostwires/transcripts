Changelog: 

* Several people have pointed out to me that the transcript to [MAG152, A Gravedigger's Envy]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/152.html), particularly the end, had some misplaced speaker labels and misheard words ("plight" for "advice", "Yosemite" for "Gethsemane", etc). I *think* I've got all those fixed.

* I've fixed a variety of minor typos in episodes in [MAG016]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/016.html) through [MAG040]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/040.html), and also added links to Google Docs documents for them.

* Changed webfont (Libre Baskerville) to be hosted from the site itself, rather than Google Fonts; let me know if anything looks weird.

As a reminder, I created this website because I have hearing issues. In general, the only episodes I've actually *listened* to are [the ones for which I personally wrote the transcripts]({{site.baseurl}}/sources.html#snarp) while having a Good Ear Day.

So, if you have normal hearing and want to make a correction, __please send me an actual cleaned-up transcript, or at least a list of the specific errors you noticed.__ Telling me "the end of episode X has a lot of problems" is unlikely to help, because I typically won't be able to listen to it.

Please [email me](mailto:snarp@snarp.work) if you run into any problems!

(Also, I have to be out of town tomorrow, so the transcript PROBABLY won't be crossposted from [@tmatranscripts](http://tmatranscripts.tumblr.com/) until late afternoon / evening.)
