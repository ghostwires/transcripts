Changelog:

* Edited formatting of [MAG172, Strung Out]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/172.html), to put all "stage directions" and "dialog" from the "play" in blockquotes, and added a note explaining the format of the episode.
  
  A transcript-within-a-transcript is kind of by nature hard to format clearly, and I've seen several people confused about what's going on, why Francis and the Spider don't have voice actor credits, etc. Hopefully this makes it clearer what's happening.

* Fixed typos and added editable Google Docs for official transcripts [MAG090]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/090.html) through [MAG099]({{site.baseurl}}/tma/099.html).
