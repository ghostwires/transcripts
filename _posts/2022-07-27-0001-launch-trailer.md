##### [SFX: beneath a stormy sea, bubbles]

##### [Music: piercing flute, like a siren song]

##### [THE BUBBLES RISE AND THICKEN AND THEN --]

##### [SFX: SPLASH! We're above ground. A musket shot, footsteps pounding through brush]

#### SIVA

_(panting in terror)_ Ah! Ah!

#### SOLDIERS

_(distant, overlapping voices)_ After him! That way, come on, with me! No, that way! Come aground!

##### [SFX: a wave crashes over the scene and we cut to: a crew cheering, wind in the sails. The captain speaks --]

#### GAMMON

_(slow, victorious)_ My girls return! _(louder)_ And they've only gone and got the *bloody swag!*

##### [SFX: He kicks something over. Small metallic pieces -- gold coins -- pour onto the deck, rolling off in all directions. CHEERS! FOOT-STAMPING! PIRATES!!!!]

##### [THE CHEERS FADE INTO THE RUMBLINGS OF A FARAWAY STORM. EVERYTHING IS quiet and hushed - a burnt-out-sounding husk of a place. Distantly, insects buzz. Pottery crunches underfoot.]

##### [MUSIC FADES IN. IT SOUNDS -- IS THERE SUCH A THING AS LIVELY *AND* MOURNING?]

#### NOOR

_(echoey)_ Oh Allah, elevate her station among those who are guided. Send her along the path of those who came before, and forgive us and her, oh Lord of the worlds...

##### [MUSIC KICKS UP A NOTCH]

Enlarge for her her grave, and shed light upon her in it.

##### [SFX: Thunder rolls, waves crash along the deck] 

#### ALESTES

_(audibly grinning)_ Storm's right where we want it, Baker. Better get your arse in gear. Brace on my command.

Ready -- set --

##### [SFX: the wind changes, catching in the sails. ALESTES laughs to herself -- anticipation, delight, freedom.]

##### [THEME MUSIC]

#### VOICE

Rusty Quill Presents: *Trice Forgotten.* Premiering August the second, 2022, wherever you get your podcasts.
