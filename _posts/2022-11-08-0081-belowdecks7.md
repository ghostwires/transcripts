#### NEMO

Hello and welcome to the seventh episode of Below Decks, where we dig into some of the research questions, stories and generally tangential interesting things that went into making *Trice Forgotten.* I'm Nemo, my pronouns are they/them, and I'm the creator and lead writer of the series. This episode is coming out after episode eight of the podcast, "A Rigged Game," where Siva has introduced the crew to Kalitivu, we've met Mary, and Alestes has made some threats.

Today on Below Decks, we're going to be talking about soundscaping *Trice Forgotten,* and I'm delighted to be talking to two of our audio designers, Cathy Rinella and Katie Seaton. Just wanted to say Maddy was also supposed to be here, but unfortunately she's unwell today. So just wanted to acknowledge her efforts for this show too.

So let's do Katie, then Cathy. Could you introduce yourself with your pronouns and tell us a bit about what you do on the show? 

#### KATIE

Hello? Yeah, Katie here. Uh, billed as Katharine on the show notes, I think, which -- and so is Cathy, 'cause we like to confuse you. _(laughs)_ My pronouns is she/her. I am one of the soundscapers, and also editing in the music and occasionally writing a little bit of extra music where it's needed. 

#### NEMO

Amazing. Cathy?

#### CATHY

I'm Cathy, my pronouns are she/her, and I am the masterer for *Trice Forgotten* and a lot of the other, uh, Rusty Quill productions. I basically go in and I make sure everything is good to go post-soundscaping and then it's ready to, uh, be heard by our lovely audience. 

#### NEMO

So I wanted to start off by saying that this show is edited by a huge group of people. Um, we've got Maddy Searle, Nico Vettese, Tessa Vroom, Lowri Ann Davies, James Austin, and of course you two, Katie and Cathy. And you kind of briefly described a little bit about what you do, things like mastering. From my outsider position, I've seen that there's things like a rough cut, a vocal cut, a music cut. Um, can you explain to a listener what all of these things are and why there are so many drafts of the show, I guess

#### KATIE

Who's gonna take that one? 

#### CATHY

So I started laughing cause there's so many cuts, there's so many cuts all over the place. I can give a breakdown and Katie, maybe you can kinda, like, describe like the difference between what it is now and what it was before, because I'm still relatively a newbie.

The process kind of goes, we start with the vocals with all the lines that have been recorded, the raw recordings, and our vocal cut editor goes in and uses all of the notes from directors and producers to piece together a rough cut of the audio, which is basically a working cut of all of the actors' lines in the approximation of both timing and takes that were desired to create the full story. Because all of our actors, because they record remotely, we do multiple takes in these recording sessions.

From there the rough cut goes to be reviewed by Raf as director, who then checks to see which, which takes are good, if something needs to be swapped out, if we've got something missing, either the vocal cut editor or Raf makes a flag of it saying "Hey, this wasn't in the script," or "Hey, we need to add this." And once we have those notes and we find all the materials to make those corrections, then the rough cut becomes the vocal cut, which is then cleaned up and sent off to the soundscapers. Soundscaping does... um, Katie if you wanna jump in and describe the, the soundscaping? 

#### KATIE

Okay. So we set it into a workflow where Maddy does the initial pass on getting it all put together and creating the world. There's been a few episodes where it's been someone else, and the first couple Tessa and Maddy sort of did it as a team, and the third episode was all me. And then we sort of settled into what we're doing now, which is: Maddy goes in at first and adds all the ambiances and builds sort of a really immersive, sort of authentic feeling place to be for the actors. And, and then obviously we start sort of putting in all the movements and the little bits of foreground, um, detail that tell us what they're doing, give us that sense of authenticity that makes us believe that the characters are really there and really, really real people.

#### NEMO

Mhm.

#### KATIE

Cathy then takes a look with a fresh pair of ears for audio quality and whether it's kind of landing right. You know, 'cause it can be hard when you spent 20 hours auditioning 300 different sounds to try and find the right one, or going off with your microphone to try and record them and put it all together. You kind of go, "I dunno if this works or not now. Yeah, I'm done." You know, and so it's good to have someone to hand over to to listen to with fresh ears and um, Cathy will make lots of notes and give feedback. 

#### CATHY

Sorry.

#### KATIE

Which -- _(laughs)_ nah, that's fine. 

#### NEMO

Lots of notes is good. I say as someone who doesn't get them.

#### KATIE

I personally am quite unusual in audio post cause I quite enjoy working through a list of notes because it means none of that annoying thinking, cause I'm literally just tick, tick, tick.

Yeah.

So it is quite relaxing when you've done the initial post, just be working through director's notes or whatever, and Maddy and I share our actioning notes, though some things have to be done by Maddy because it's on her computer and it's in her project and we don't work in the same digital audio workstation so we can't quite seriously share projects. And then I will do some of it as well for various reasons. Either just to take workload off her, or because there's something which is particularly my thing -- I'm quite into soundset dialogue and merge. I'm quite into first-person point of view, and obviously because I'm doing the music and I'm also a musician, I'm quite into sounds that blend with music and how they interact, 'cause that can sometimes do something really magical. So those sorts of things. Or if it's timing -- like, we're trying to adjust the timing of how the characters are moving or speaking, music might have an impact on what we wanna do there. Which is the big difference between audio drama and film when you're working in post, 'cause in audio drama you've got a lot more, um, creative power, I suppose, to reconstruct something to work. Whereas in film you are much more following what the editor has already decided.

Right.

So yeah, for timing reasons, if I'm reading the edit a little bit, I might take that on, and then obviously I'll be editing in Sam's music, Sam's wonderful music, which I'm sure we're gonna come to, and passing that on to Raf -- a final check to make sure it works for Raf too. And then Cathy will take it and do the final processes, get it ready to go out, get it the right loudness and get all the, you know, all the specs in and stuff that.

#### NEMO

It's, oh my gosh, like I knew how much effort goes into it, but you just talking about it -- I'm like, "Wow, I didn't know how much effort went into it." _(laughs)_ It's so many different people listening to make sure that everything sounds good to multiple people as well. Ugh. Ugh, you're so impressive. I'm so in awe.

So we've had some, like, pretty fun conversations about really, like, really specific sounds needed for this show. I know that Maddy said it took her a surprisingly long time to find the right fish-flapping sound effects when I'm working on the design for Episode 5, when the crew are trawling. Are there sounds that you are really happy with that you think an audience might not, like, appreciate how difficult it was to find?

#### KATIE

Mhm.

#### NEMO

Slow nodding. Yes, there are. Next question. _(laughs)_

#### KATIE

That's always the case though. The curse of the sound person is often, if you get it right, that's when people don't notice. 

#### NEMO

Yeah. 

#### KATIE

Because you can spend sometimes half an hour just tweaking automation and perspective and stuff, to make sure that footsteps really sound like they're coming from over there and this person really...

#### CATHY

Mhm, mhm.

#### KATIE

And if you get it right, it just sounds like the world 'cause that's what you're going for, and people will switch off because they're not even paying attention to the sound. So it's surprising how that kind of thing, getting a door close right, or getting footsteps oriented right, or something like that. Or getting somebody who's speaking in the mid-distance to *sound* like they're speaking in the mid-distance can be harder than, like, the really dramatic sounds that everyone notices.

Like in the trailer, there was a moment right at the beginning of the trailer where the little girl was being pulled out the water, and that was quite a dramatic sound and very fun to create. But actually, you know, it, it wasn't the hardest bit, _(laughs)_ you know? Right, so... 

#### CATHY

Yeah, I think to go off of what Katie's mentioned, it's deceptive in that some of the hardest stuff is a lot of the mundane stuff because there's so much in day-to-day sounds that people hear that they've come to expect to hear, so they don't realize they're hearing it. So it's like the type of footfalls, the sounds of, of the air and the soundscape around you, the sounds that people make when they're fidgeting, when their clothes move. And there's a very fine process of recognizing that those sounds need to be in there and then understanding how to execute them. 

#### KATIE

Mhm.

#### CATHY

Footsteps are a huge deal. And, and Katie, correct me if I'm wrong, but we've not really had much work in the way of footsteps in most of our past series. *Stellar Firma* might be where we've had the most of any of that, but...

#### KATIE

I don't really, yeah. I've not been working in this side of things for Rusty Quill for that long, actually. Um, I was doing most of my sound work outside of Rusty Quill. Yeah. But *Stellar* is quite formulaic. It's got kind of, like, a more of a cartoony feel. So I think the footsteps are pretty much the same each time. So probably this is the first time we're doing this kind of thing, yeah. 

#### CATHY

Yeah, exactly. *Magnus Archives* is, you're stuck in the tape recording atmosphere. 

#### KATIE

Yeah. 

#### CATHY

Basically, *Stellar Firma,* you're in the room with David-7 and you are just, you get to hear whatever, whatever happens that day. *Rusty Quill Gaming* revolves around a storytelling aspect, where you don't cue in all of the passive action or else it's gonna be too distracting from the actual story that's being told. Same for *Chapter & Multiverse.* So digging into *Trice* has meant that our editors have had to rethink how to develop soundscaping, how to deploy it, and how to find the right balance to both create a very realistic immersive soundscape without going overboard and trying to find the right balance of like, "how do we make this fit into the scene." It's getting back to, to my original example of footsteps. It's one of those things where if you hear it done right, you don't notice it. 

#### NEMO

Yeah. 

#### CATHY

If you hear it done wrong, you know, _(laughs)_ it's not right. It's usually very static or the, the tempo is off. So it sounds like: tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip. Like if we're running and it's really not -- _(laughs)_ somebody has gotten, like, their coconuts going, and it's not working. 

#### KATIE

I mean, to add to that, the challenge specifically with *Trice* is we have two layers of removal from the world that we're familiar with. Geographical, for most of us, and historical. And I've spent quite a lot of time, 'cause this, I think this is my first historical production. Listening to what I've got and trying to decide whether that rumble is traffic, 'cause my ears are so used to having the traffic sounds. I almost dunno what it sounds like when it's not there. 

#### CATHY

Mhm.

#### NEMO

Yeah. 

#### KATIE

You know, so sometimes you, I've been able to source sounds from Sri Lanka, which is authentic geographically, but I'm there going, "Is that a car?"

#### CATHY

Mhm.

#### KATIE

And, you know, is, is that enough of a car that I can EQ it out or am I gonna have to go and find something without a car? In which case it's the middle of nowhere and that's not what I need either, you know, and, and then you find we are building up with multiple layers. Some of the ambiances I've been building, like in Episode 3 I had, oh, I think 15 different layers of ambience 

#### CATHY

---


#### CATHY

mm-hmm. <affirmative>. 

#### NEMO

Oh my gosh. 

#### KATIE

Cause I was having to construct it in a much more kind of from first principles kind of way, you know? And that's, that's without all the sound effects and the vocals on top of it, you know, So 

#### CATHY

---


#### KATIE

Yeah, yeah. Episode six. Yeah. So as it so happened we could resolve that kind of question that the music was asking at the end of the dialogue between Alestes and Gammon was kind of resolved with the outro. Yep, you're right, there's more to come kind of thing, I had to, I had to do like a cheeky little pitch shift there to make that work out, but it was worth, it was worth it. 

#### NEMO

Oh yeah, that was on the question is "What are you willing to give?" Right. And then Yeah. 

#### KATIE

Yeah, exactly! 

#### NEMO

I thought that was so, it was so cool. I was like, Yeah. 

#### KATIE

And it's interesting when you're a music, editing obviously with the background of composing, for me it's like I've got this material, it's, in some ways it's quite limiting, but when you get that moment where something just works out so well, it's so fun. It's, Oh yeah, there we go. It's like, it's like finding buried treasure, which is quite appropriate for <laughster>. Yeah. I guess the other thing I enjoy doing when it's possible is merging it in with the drama and the, you know, having the internal rhythm of the scene reflected in the musi, like quite overtly. Obviously episode five is the one we did that the most in cause we had all those trolling sequences with the "heave, heave" and I ended up re-editing the vocal cut in order to put all those heaves on the beat the music. 

#### NEMO

Ah, yeah! 

#### KATIE

Which helped to kind of make the sequence into one great big long montage almost with the dialogues in between them kind of punctuating the montage and, and the music kind of doing that each time gave that sense of continuity over that whole of that middle section of that episode. So that's another thing music's lovely for, Music's lovely for loads of stuff. <laugh>. 

#### NEMO

Yeah. It's so cool. So much thought. I hope, Yeah. That a listener does come away from this episode and re listens to all of the episode and just like starts noticing some of the small things. Like, I mean, as you were saying, like obviously if you are doing the naturalistic stuff right, you are not supposed to be noticing them. But I do hope that people do come away from this. Like, there's one of the reasons why I suggested this episode was cause I know some of the really cool things that happened on these episodes and just wanted to like, yeah, appreciate how much work you people are doing <laugh> and yeah, the, the putting things on the beat might not sound like a, a huge thing, but it does, it changes the, the tone and it changes how it lands with you and it makes you feel the excitement, it makes you feel on board with everyone and yeah, I just wanted to be like, look how cool everyone is laugh>, um, 

#### KATIE

What's it like to write a thing and to look something that's cool come out your brain and to sort of hear it become an actual thing. 

#### NEMO

It's really amazing. Like, I obviously did put things in like, something's in like, oh, you know, there's a bird or you know, ching ching ching. They have a sword fight, but actually hearing it, um, and I think it is actually the things like the bracelets and the footsteps and just the um, reality of it, the fake reality I of it I guess, where I'm like, it's so much better than I could ever imagine <laugh> because I'm not an audio person. I'm not an audio designer. And yeah, I I think it's just so beautiful and yeah, that, that moment, cause it was the last episode that I listened to the episode six, the like, "what are you willing to give" and flowing into the music, I was just like, Gah! Yeah. Yeah. Like I could never have written that and it just, it worked so well and yeah. 

#### KATIE

So that was, that was particularly good because it's like, cause in, in terms of the um, story arc of the season s well. You know, it was good to draw attention to kind of that pivotal moment. Yeah. Anyway, 

#### NEMO

<laugh>. So yeah, I'm very appreciative. Okay, amazing. I feel like that's a really, really great place to wrap up. Thank you so much for being here. Katie and Cathy, if people wanted to hear more from you here, see more from you, where can they find you online? 

#### KATIE

Uh, yeah, I'm on Twitter. I'm at KatieSeaton9, as in the digit. It's not very easy to say 

#### NEMO

<laugh>. That's great. And that's Seaton, s e a t o n. That's 

#### CATHY

Right. And me, I'm not really on social media, but I do lurk on Twitch. I'm Lily Foxglove if anybody sees me lurking in various streams 

#### NEMO

Amazing. Cool. So let's wrap up here. Thank you so much Katie and Cathy for joining me. That's it from me, Nemo and goodbye, from Katie and Cathy. 

#### KATIE

Bye. 

#### CATHY

Bye! We'll see you next time Below Decks.
