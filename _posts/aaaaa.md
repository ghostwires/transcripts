This is Delta Team, sector 11, [inaudible] confirmed

...I've got nothing.

Confirmed

#### HEIDI

Christ, I hate the

#### DAVE

This is nothing. You should've been here the first couple of years. Nasty business.

#### HEIDI

That's what they tell me. Can't imagine it being that much worse, though, really.

#### DAVE

_(chuckles)_ You've only been here, what, a couple of weeks?

#### HEIDI

A month.

#### DAVE

And you've had *how* many proper contacts?

#### HEIDI

...What counts as a proper contact?

...

Just one.

#### DAVE

Time was they'd be *every* other day, though that was just the ones we knew about. Still. You don't hear me complaining about it.

#### HEIDI

What?

#### DAVE

_(slowly)_ I need you to tell me what I'm seeing.

#### HEIDI

*What?*

#### DAVE

Just do it. I -- want to be certain.

#### HEIDI

Uh... okay. Er, looks like a cassette player. Pretty banged up, and do you want me to --

#### DAVE

No! No. No, don't touch it.

...I was certain we'd gotten them all by now, especially in this sector.

#### HEIDI

Perhaps it's new!

#### DAVE

Oh god, I hope not. That would be -- Well, it might be nothing! Or it might be *very bad.*

#### HEIDI

So what do we do, smash it?

#### DAVE

Leave it. Note the location in the log and if it's still here when Echo Team come through, well, then we start to worry.

Fall behind, left behind, rookie!

##### ALICE

That's... That's Colin, isn't it.

#### GWEN

Don't *touch* it! This is a crime scene now. Someone (inaudible) someone's severed hand into the server so we need to find the police. Right now.

#### ALICE

It's Colin. It's him, I know it is.

#### GWEN

No you don't. It could be anyone's... severed hand.

#### ALICE

There's no blood.

#### GWEN

What?

#### ALICE

Look! There's no blood! On his hand, his phone, the entire server rack is... clean.

So -- whoever did it cleaned up after themselves. Even more reason to call the police. They have all kinds of DNA tests and forensic --

#### ALICE

Just look, Gwen!

#### GWEN

I am looking!

#### ALICE

There's cables running through it and it looks like it's attached right to the electrics.

#### GWEN

How's it even still working?

#### ALICE

That wasn't just shoved in there by someone. It looks more like it came from inside the system --

#### GWEN

Alice, stop. Please.

I'm going to call the police. I'm going to call the police, and tell them what we found, and you're not going to mention your wild theory --

#### ALICE

Gwen, we need to call Lena.

#### GWEN

Well Lena isn't here, so --

#### ALICE

Uh... Gwen, you might want to hold up on that phone call.

#### GWEN

Alice, for god's sake!

#### ALICE

It's gone.

#### GWEN

What is?

...The hand? When did that happen?

#### ALICE

I don't know! Just now, I-I turned to look at you and then when I looked back it was just gone!

#### GWEN

Don't be ridiculous, it can't just be gone, you must have just --

#### ALICE

I don't think the police can help with this.

#### GWEN

Then what exactly do you propose?

#### ALICE

We call Lena!

#### GWEN

I am in charge.

#### ALICE

Are you?! It's been one night! One. Night. And Sam's gone, and Lena's gone, and -- and Colin's been eaten by the computer or something --

#### GWEN

Don't say that, that's not what happened!

#### ALICE

Then what did happen?! Hm?!

#### GWEN

I don't --

What's that?!

#### ALICE

Sounded like a beep.

#### GWEN

Obviously it's a beep, what I meant is --

#### ALICE

Gwen.

#### GWEN

...I see it.

Open it, Alice.

#### ALICE

*You* open it!

#### GWEN

You're being foolish.

#### ALICE

If it can do that to Colin, it can open its own *damn* cases.

#### GWEN

Oh for goodness sake.

#### GWEN

...

Well, now we know.

#### ALICE

Freddy killed Colin. It killed him.

#### GWEN

It definitely sounds like the system was provoked, and...

#### ALICE

Don't you do that. Don't you *dare* do that. It *murdered him.*

#### GWEN

I just meant that I don't think we're in any danger as long as we don't antagonize it.

#### ALICE

So what? We're hostages now?

#### GWEN

No! No, I'm sure we can leave.

...Um. Freddy. *Can* we leave?

#### ALICE

*Jesus Christ,* what happened to you being in charge?

#### GWEN

I *am* in charge, and now we've established there is no further risk to staff and a police response would be... inappropriate, I think it would be best if we take a moment to... to assess the situation, and, um...

#### ALICE

Gwen. Where. Is. Lena.

#### GWEN

I *really* don't know how much clearer I can be. The minister decided to have her replaced, and gave me the job.

#### ALICE

What, just like that? No exit interview? No handover?

#### GWEN

Just like that. Now Alice, I need you to please explain to me again what you meant when you said Sam was "gone." Is he dead?

#### ALICE

*No!*

...At least, Celia doesn't seem to think so.

#### GWEN

And what does Celia know about this? Where is she?

#### ALICE

I told you! She's gone home!

She was there when it happened. She saw Sam fall into th-- well, I don't know what it is! Celia said it was a "tear," if that means anything? He was fighting the Archivist, and, and then they --

#### GWEN

Enough. Enough. Obviously we need to bring Celia back in.

#### ALICE

Jog on.

#### GWEN

Look. I know everyone has been through a lot, but, it's clear to me that none of us is operating with complete information at the moment. So if it really is just three of us left, then we need to put our heads together and get on the same page as soon as possible, and that starts with Celia telling me her account of things.

#### ALICE

*Fine.* Whatever.

#### GWEN

Excellent. With any luck, we'll find Sam and be back up and running in no time.

Wait -- Wait for me--!

---

##### [Tape recorder]

##### [Sam rasping in pain]

#### SAM

(inaudible)

I need help.

I need help. I need --

Get away from me.

##### [Stumbling backwards]

---

##### [Jack crying]

##### [Celia shushing him]

#### CELIA

It's okay. Yeah. It's okay. I know. Mummy's here.

##### [Jack crying]

#### CELIA

Don't worry about Mummy. Don't worry anymore. I'm not going anywhere. I promise. It's over now. And Sam -- Sam will be okay. Mummy was okay, so he will be too.

Everything's going to be okay. Everything is going to be... okay.

There you go. Yes.

##### [Jack quiets down]

##### [Door opens]

#### ALICE

Celia, I'm sorry but you've got to come in. Gwen's --

#### CELIA

Shh! I just got Jack to sleep.

Come in.

#### ALICE

You've got to come back to the office. Now. It's -- it's all screwed up. Colin's dead, and Lena's gone, and Gwen says she's in charge but that *can't* be right because she has *no* idea what's going on. And --

#### CELIA

Hold on! Hold on. Slow down.

Colin's *dead?*

#### ALICE

Yeah. We think Freddy killed him.

#### CELIA

Freddy. As in --

#### ALICE

The case system. Yeah. He was -- chopped up inside the computer, and -- and it's all a mess, I don't know what to do, you need to get back to the office.

#### CELIA

No, I don't, Alice. And neither do you.

#### ALICE

What are you saying?

#### CELIA

We can choose not to get involved. The O.I.A.R. is a government department, right? Sounds like a problem for the government?

#### ALICE

What? No, that's not -- What about Sam?

#### CELIA

Sam's gone, Alice.

#### ALICE

You keep saying that, it still doesn't mean anything! Where is he gone?

#### CELIA

I -- I don't know. Not exactly. That thing -- in the basement -- the tear, I think -- I think it leads to somewhere else.

#### ALICE

Meaning?

#### CELIA

Another world, or dimension, or something.

#### ALICE

And how exactly do you know that?

#### CELIA

I --

Recognised it from a case.

#### ALICE

...Right. In that case, I'm going in after him. Yeah. We'll tie a rope to my waist, and --

#### CELIA

Alice, you *can't.*

#### ALICE

Says who?

#### CELIA

We don't know what'll happen! Even assuming you both survived, how do we know you'll even end up in the same place?!

#### ALICE

Then what do we *do?!* Because we *are* going to do something. You're the reason Sam was left alone in the first place, and you owe it to us to *help get him back.*

##### [Jack starts crying again]

#### CELIA

You're right. Just -- let me settle him back down, and I'll call my babysitter.

#### ALICE

Good.

...Thank you.

#### CELIA

Come on, baby. Come on. Shhh.

##### [Phone rings]

##### [Jack wails]

#### ALICE

It's Gwen.

---

#### ALICE

*What.*

#### GWEN

Alice, have you got Celia yet? Are you on your way back?

#### ALICE

Yeah, she's coming. We're sorting some stuff out.

#### GWEN

Well, hurry up and come back here.

#### ALICE

What's wrong? Not feeling so in charge now you're alone in the office with a killer computer?

#### GWEN

...It's using the photocopier.

#### ALICE

What do you mean, it's using the photoco--

#### GWEN

It's printing his face. Colin's face. Over and over. It won't stop. I tried pulling the plug, but it's still going.

#### ALICE

Oh *god.* He'd hate that. He always wanted to (inaudible)

#### GWEN

Alice, how can you joke at a time like this? A man is dead.

#### ALICE

Oh, because right now it's laugh or cry and at least Colin would have found that funny!

#### GWEN

Whatever, just hurry up.

#### ALICE

We'll be there to change your nappy just as soon as we've finished with Jack's.

#### GWEN

Alice --

#### ALICE

Just don't open any email attachments until we get there.

#### GWEN

Alice don't you *dare* hang up --

---

#### SAM

Just -- leave me alone!

Leave me alone!

_(coughing)_ Don't -- No--!

#### DAVE

(inaudible) some kind of lump thing, or?

#### SAM

Help me!

#### DAVE

I think it's a person!

#### SAM

Please --

#### DAVE

How the hell did you get in here?

#### SAM

I, I don't --

#### DAVE

Never mind. You can tell us later. For now we can deal with this nasty [] that's on your trail.

#### SAM

I-I need your help.

#### DAVE

Yeah, I heard you the first time, but can you whistle?

#### SAM

Just shoot them!

#### DAVE

Won't do much good. that's how you [inaudible] stay here and get messed up nice and proper by your new mates, you better start whistling something bloody cheerful. Nice and loud now!

##### [Cheerful whistling]

#### DAVE

No! Circus music?! Fucking Christ alive! Something *cheerful,* something nice. Right now.

##### [Cheerful whistling]

#### DAVE

That's better. Not exactly good but it'll do. They're coming. Fix smart, don't stop whistling. Nice and loud now.

##### [More whistling]

#### CELIA

Thanks *so* much for coming out at such short notice, Georgie. I know it's late.

#### GEORGIE

Ah, you know I'm a night owl. I mean, [] but still.

#### CELIA

Right. And everything is the usual place, and I just put Jack back down to sleep, so he *should* stay down right through to morning.

#### GEORGIE

No problem if he doesn't. I'll be up either way.

#### CELIA

You're a godsend.

#### GEORGIE

I know. So go on, then, what counts as an "emergency" at a government data entry job? Did a spreadsheet catch fire?

#### CELIA

Something like that.

Listen, Georgie, I know I've been calling you a lot lately.

#### GEORGIE

Which is fine.

#### CELIA

But I just want you to know, I think things are looking up. All going well, this should be the last zero-notice callout.

#### GEORGIE

We'll see.

#### ALICE

Cab's here.

#### GEORGIE

A cab? Wow, it must be urgent.

#### CELIA

Thanks again, Georgie. Any issues, just call me.

#### GEORGIE

Away with you. Auntie Georgie's got everything in hand here.

#### DAVE(?)

Hello.

##### [Sam struggles to sit up]

##### [Footsteps]

#### SAM

Is this -- Is this necessary?

Can you please tell me where I am?

#### DAVE(?)

_(cheerfully)_ Shut up.

#### SAM

I want a solicitor.

#### DAVE(?)

I said, shut up. Captain should be here soon.

#### SAM

And they'll explain?

#### DAVE(?)

They'll decide what to do with you.

#### SAM

Alright.

...Can I please lie down?

[]

#### DAVE(?)

Captain?

#### GEORGIE

Dave. Report?

#### DAVE(?)

Got some weird readings at the center of the mile. Me and Heidi went to check it out, found... this.

#### GEORGIE

Hm. []

#### SAM

For god's sake...

#### DAVE(?)

[] He's in a bad way, though. Malnourishment, apparently. Doc wants him on a drip, but I told him you'd need to give the okay.

#### GEORGIE

Thanks, Dave. I'll take it from here. See if you can find where he got in. There wasn't a breach alert, so if we have a gap, I want to know about it.

I'll be fine.

#### DAVE(?)

Sure thing, Captain. I'll leave someone outside, just in case.

#### GEORGIE

Fine.

##### [Door closes]

#### SAM

Hello.

#### GEORGIE

Sam, is it?

#### SAM

I want a solicitor.

#### GEORGIE

I'm not sure we've got any left.

#### SAM

_(softly)_ What?

...Where am I?

#### GEORGIE

Name?

#### SAM

Samama. Khalid.

#### GEORGIE

Right, Samama. So --

#### SAM

Sam.

#### GEORGIE

Sam. You're in a warden facility on the edge of the London Exclusion Zone.

#### SAM

How did I get here?

#### GEORGIE

From what I hear, you got a ride in Gertrude. Should be honored! She's the longest surviving [] we've had. As for how you got right into the middle of the square mile without anyone noticing, that's something I want you to tell me.

#### SAM

That... That wasn't London. That was a nightmare.

#### GEORGIE

Hmm.

You're a dreamer, Sam? Cultist? Possessed by some talking wooden idol? Seen it all before!

#### SAM

I work for civil service.

#### GEORGIE

I stand corrected! So was that your domain, some Kafka bureaucracy thing? [] bigger ones, but it would make sense.

#### SAM

I don't...

I was falling, and then. Celia. Then you. And...

#### GEORGIE

Sam? Sam, stay with me! Why did you break into the Zone?

#### SAM

Should've... Should've drunk the tea. Nice.

#### GEORGIE

Sam?

---

#### CELIA

And then there was a flash, and I must have blacked out or something, becasue when I looked back, they were both gone.

#### GWEN

And you're certain that this is some sort of portal, that they weren't just...

#### ALICE

Don't.

#### GWEN

Disintegrated?

#### ALICE

I *swear.*

#### CELIA

Pretty sure, though I'm not sure "portal" is the right word.

#### GWEN

May I ask why?

#### ALICE

Licensing issues?

#### GWEN

Alice, please.

#### CELIA

"Portal" makes it sound like it's just a door between two places. This is -- more complicated. We don't know how many places it might lead to.

#### GWEN

Which is why you don't advise attempting a rescue.

#### CELIA

I don't think we can be sure we'll end up where he was, and even if we did, it might be impossible to get back.

#### ALICE

This is bullshit!

#### GWEN

How sure are you of this, Celia?

#### CELIA

I've processed a decent number of cases like this over the last few months. They were all pretty consistent.

#### GWEN

Then I'm inclined to believe them. Alright. Given all I've heard here, I'm making an executive decision to prohibit direct interaction with the... phenomena below the Hilltop Center until we have more information.

#### ALICE

Too bad you're not in charge.

#### GWEN

Alice. I understand that Lena's departure may have been more abrupt than you expected, but my promotion has already been officially ratified. You should have an email from the ministerial aide waiting in your inbox with the details. To put it simply: I'm your boss now, whether you like it, or not.

#### ALICE

How convenient, that your only proof is an inbox that I can't open in case it tries to eat me.

#### GWEN

It did not eat Colin! The system just... responded to an attack.

#### ALICE

By eating Colin.

#### GWEN

I'm sure that as long as we don't follow in his footsteps, we can maintain business as usual.

#### CELIA

Gwen, this is serious. I don't think "business as usual" is going to cut it. Can you contact anyone more senior?

#### GWEN

The minister is...

#### ALICE

A useless sack of skin?

#### GWEN

Very busy. And even if I were to raise this, I doubt he could be much help. I'd be jeopardizing this office for nothing.

#### ALICE

Jeopardizing your *payrise* maybe. Colin's dead. Sam's dead. And your grand plan is to what? Keep calm and carry on?

#### GWEN

It's essential that we understand what happened to Sam and what's going on with the system *before* we take any action. I just think it would be better if we kept such investigation... off the books, as it were.

#### CELIA

That... makes sense.

#### GWEN

Naturally, neither I nor the O.I.A.R. accept liability for your safety in these investigations, since they are not part of your official work duties. That said, I will, of course, understand if you both wish to leave. I'll even add a competitive severance package, which I think is *more* than generous given the circumstances.

#### ALICE

Piss off. We're staying.

#### CELIA

I...

#### ALICE

Celia, please. We've got to get him back.

#### CELIA

...

Okay.

#### ALICE

Thank you.

#### GWEN

Right! Well in that case, if there's nothing else, I believe you both have an *extensive* backlog to be getting on with.

#### ALICE

Meaning all your old cases, right?

#### GWEN

_(sigh)_ Partially. Now, if you don't mind, I am very busy.

Oh, and Alice? I expect you to show me a little more respect moving forward. I am your manager, after all.

#### ALICE

Hm. Then, respectfully, you can kiss my ar--

---

#### HEIDI

Just finishing sector 11 now. No breaches in or out, all seems solid. Over.

#### DAVE

Yeah. Nothing in sector 7 either. How the hell did he get in?

#### HEIDI

Beats me. Moving on to 12.

##### [Footsteps]

Still here, then. Hmm. Wait. You're still running. Oh, shit. You're -- recording me. Recording me so closely. Beady camera eyes pushing ever nearer. Scanning for a [] a shudder, a crack in the facade. To show that I was weak. That I trembled. That I was afraid.

They watched me every second of every minute of every hour of every day, of every week of every month of every year of every eternity that was no time at all, and above it all the thing for which the cameras danced, the great and terrible Eye that watched it all.

It came to me when I was watching as well. Working security, walking the halls, watching the portraits as they watched me back. Like I was trained. Police, not long, couple of months. Bad culture fit, they said, but that was okay. Always another job for a watcher. The [] came and stared and gorged, and I watched them in turn. Sat in the corner of a gallery all through pixellated camera eyes.

I liked it. I felt powerful.

We had all heard of the Magnus Institute. The weirdos next door, that grand old building where people took their ghosts and their stories and got nightmares in return. Pasty academics and shifty-looking bookworms that never looked you in the eye. But one day, it was gone. It was all gone. The world and the people and London and you. And all that was left was the watching, and the Institute, [] over everything.

Then the cameras turned on me. Long metal legs sharp and scraping as they chased me through the streets. They clambered over empty buildings, crawled through broken windows and pushed their way up through rusted sewer grates. Always searching for me. Always staring at me, closer, closer. Focused. Hungry.

Their lenses were cracked and shattered but it didn't matter. If they caught you, cornered you, pinned you with their razor tripod legs, then those lenses would open, cracked glass blossoming like iris leached jaws, and they would cut you with their jagged edges, and as you bled, as you screamed and cried and begged, they did not drink you, they did not eat you, they watched. They watched and watched and watched your crimson fear as it trickled down to the floor, bloodshot eyes behind broken lenses.

Sometimes you could hide. The corner of a darkened flat. Halfway up a long quiet tower block. Under the stinking cardboard at the end of a blind alley. In the basement ever silent sharp among the plastic reminders of a time when joy existed.

But you would still hear the cameras searching for you. Skittering. Scratching. Panning left to right as they sniffed you out.

Hiding was no relief, just a different sort of terror. The lingering sickness of anticipation building to the sharp peak of panic as you heard the whirring of their zoom in the shadows. And then you were running once again. I wasn't alone, but it didn't matter. The streets were empty and the other poor lost souls of London were only there to run, to cry, to bleed, to fear.

If you found another, a fellow victim of the Scrutiny, there was a moment of hope. But it was a bitter hope that you might trick them, shove them, cry out and reveal their hiding spot, feed them to the cameras so you might have a minute, a second, an instant of *peace.* Albeit one tainted by guilt.

I used to see them in my dreams. Those others who fled with me. I knew their faces and we ran together in our sleep long after the nightmare ended, but I did not search for them, did not embrace it. And eventually the dreams faded.

But the scars didn't. Not when the Tower fell and the Eye closed. Not when the Pupil collapsed and the Archivist died, his face still burned into my mind. Not when I picked myself up in a cracked but unbroken world. Not when people started to use words like "recover," "rebuild" or "renew." The scars carved into me by those hungry cameras still stood stark.

I couldn't move on. Couldn't leave it behind. No previous words from pompous shrinks could help me. Their eyes were as hollow and dead as mine. Not that I could bear to look at them.

So I came here. If I cannot escape, then neither can they. I would keep the lingering things of dread contained and be the Watcher once more.

But now... I know it was for *nothing.*

I know this feeling. I know what it is to be watched, judged, scrutinized. To have your terror run from you like water from a dirty rag, leaving you twisted and dry and empty. I cannot stop you. And I know that this is the end. But with the last of me -- of my *fear* -- you can take my hate. My loathing.

This place is not for you. There is no place left for monsters.

We -- will -- be -- your -- *end* -- and I -- will -- []
