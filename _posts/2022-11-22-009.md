##### [Show Theme -- Intro] 

##### [INT. NANI'S HOUSE -- EVENING -- PAST]

##### [The sounds of bubbling food, fussing with pots and pans] 

#### NANI

_(singing:)_  
Khoka ghumalo, para juralo  
Khoka ghumalo, para juralo

Borgi elo deshe  
Bulbuli-te dhan kheyeche  
Khajna debo kishe  
Dhan phuralo, pan phuralo  
Khajnar upay ki!  
Aar kota din shobur koro  
Roshun bunechi... 

_(to Siva)_ Ekhana'o jagrata, paetiya? [Translation: Still awake, small one?]

#### SIVA

I'm not a baby, Nani. And we're supposed to speak English at home. 

#### NANI

...One day you'll look back on days like this and wish you still had your Nani to pamper her "baby" with lullabies. 

#### SIVA

It's not pampering if you don't let me do any of the fun parts. 

#### NANI

"Fun parts!" Cooking is cooking, paetiya. 

#### SIVA

If that means I never have to grind rice again. 

#### NANI

Who's ever heard of such a lazy child! 

#### SIVA

We could buy bread from the market... 

#### NANI

You can eat their bread when you're in their camp. In my house you eat my food. 

#### SIVA

...Nani? Do you ever wish you were still back in Bengal? 

#### NANI

And now he's so sick of me, he wants to send me back! 

#### SIVA

No! I just... You don't talk about it. Do you miss it? 

#### NANI

What's to miss? I saw as much of opar Bangla as I've seen of Kalitivu. 

#### SIVA

You don't remember it at all? 

#### NANI

Domestic servant to Governor Peters, property of Heer Keijl... they all have marble floors to sweep and silk bedding to clean. Who has the time to make memories? It was green, and gold, and beautiful, and I was just a child. But it hurts, to pine for a place, and for people you can never return to. It is my only hope that you make it through this life without experiencing that, my child.

But sad thoughts will spoil the food. Tell me, did something nice happen to you today? 

#### SIVA

Sergeant Corey came to see me! 

#### NANI

Oh? 

#### SIVA

He said, he's seen my maps, and he was going to personally hand them to Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw! 

#### NANI

Did he tell you when he's going to do that? 

#### SIVA

Only that the level of detail in them was a sure way to get myself recognised! He really seemed to think that if this operation they're planning is successful, they might employ me as a real cartographer! 

#### NANI

And then you ride that glory across the sea to Cambridge, to this Queen's Museum. 

#### SIVA

That's what Private Pearson said! 

#### NANI

I see. Khoka... Just be careful. For me. 

##### [INT. SIVA'S LOCKED ROOM -- THE PRESENT -- DAY]

##### [SIVA breathes, quietly, trying to contain himself] 

#### MARY

_(outside the room)_ Are you decent?

##### [Sound of keys. The door opens, MARY enters] 

#### MARY (CONT'D)

Hiding, Siva? Really? That's not very mature of you, I must say.

##### [BEAT]

Surrender yourself immediately or suffer the consequences, Siva.

##### [BEAT]

*Bollocks.*

##### [MARY leaves the room]

Guards! Quickly! He's escaped! 

#### SIVA

_(quiet)_ Plan: escape the scary prison room. Step one: hide in the rafters like you're in the bird's nest and Captain Alestes is angry at you -- complete. Step two: hope Mary leaves the door open, also complete. Step three, carefully... carefully... look in the corridor...

Empty. But not for long.

Shh, Siva. Be quick, be quiet. You can do this. 

##### [EXT. *NETAOANSOM* -- DAY]

#### INEZ

You're late! We thought you'd been captured. 

#### NOOR

I'm not used to mountain climbing in this humidity. 

#### INEZ

Did you find anything?

#### NOOR

I took this from one of the soldiers' camps, but I can't read it. You? 

#### INEZ

Just reports about a dread pirate roaming about, kicking doors in and smashing skulls. 

#### NOOR

...Dread pirate? Gammon and Anh? 

#### INEZ

Or Alestes.

What? I'm just saying, she disappeared on us to do who knows what, and two days later, an angry stranger is beating up locals. 

#### BAKER

Can I see that page you took, Noor?

##### [NOOR HANDS IT OVER]

#### BAKER (CONT'D)

More food, more ammo. 

#### INEZ

Didn't you say --

#### BAKER

Food, ammo, supplies, aye, that's what the soldiers on the other side of the island were lugging too. 

#### NOOR

A lot of supplies for a supposedly empty house. 

#### BAKER

Seems like something's happening at this Governor Peters's house. 

#### INEZ

...We really need to get out of here. 

#### NOOR

We need to find Siva and Alestes, and the only place we've yet to check is the Governor's house. 

#### INEZ

What's to say they're still here? They might have been carted off to some other island. Hell, Siva might be half-way to England by now. 

#### NOOR

Siva wouldn't leave, Inez. Not without saying goodbye. ...He wouldn't abandon you, if you were the one missing. 

#### INEZ

Fine. But we get in, we do one look around the place, and then we're sailing away from this whole mess. 

##### [INT. GRAHAM'S HIDEAWAY -- CORRIDOR -- DAY]

#### SIVA

Left or right. Left or right. Come on, Siva, it's an easy question! Left or right!

##### [In the distance, guards make a ruckus, raising the alarm] 

#### SIVA (CONT'D)

Come on, come on... Up the stairs, around the way and then... the window off the port bow. Port, starboard... Left! Zigzag, just like Alestes. Zigzag as you run... And hide. Zigzag. Run... And hide. Run...

##### [We hear MARY's shoes approaching]

##### [SIVA dives into a room] 

#### SIVA (CONT'D)

Hide hide hide hide hide --

##### [MARY STOPS]

#### MARY

Did you hear that?

##### [Silence as MARY and the GUARD listen] 

#### GUARD

It's just a matter of time until we find him, Lady Peters. He can't have gone far. 

#### MARY

Shh!

##### [MARY listens again]

Don't just stand there, come on. 

#### GUARD

Yes, Ma'am.

##### [SIVA exhales in relief] 

##### [INT. *NETAOANSOM* -- GALLEY -- DAY]

##### [BAKER puts a pistol on the wooden table] 

#### BAKER

I've only got the one gun, and it's not recently used. I don't know if it'll shoot proper, but it might be good to have, in case. 

#### INEZ

Great, add it to the weapon bag. 

#### BAKER

The -- what? 

#### INEZ

The weapon bag.

##### [INEZ hefts a heavy bag onto the countertop] 

#### BAKER

What -- what is all this? 

#### INEZ

Weapons. Poisons, toxins, armour plating -- all bio-natural, of course. Nothing complete, yet. 

#### BAKER

I thought you were a naturalist. 

#### INEZ

I am. 

#### BAKER

Is this --

#### INEZ 

An improvised explosive I've been tinkering with. 

#### BAKER

You've been making explosives on our ship?! A ship is made of wood. It's flammable. Where did you even get gunpowder? 

#### INEZ

Siva found it while we were making more room for the aquarium. Some of it was a bit damp, but most of it lights properly. 

#### BAKER

You --

#### NOOR

Now is not the time. 

#### BAKER

...We're going to have a serious conversation about this when we get back. 

#### INEZ

Yes, "dad." You carry the pack, Noor. That gives me and the old man easier access.

##### [NOOR hefts it onto their back] 

#### NOOR

Ready? 

#### INEZ & BAKER

Ready. 

##### [EXT. GRAHAM'S HIDEAWAY -- LAVISH LAWN -- DAY]

##### [A lawn. The peacock cries. A group of SOLDIERS (white, British) are playing cricket.] 

#### L.C. SHAW

-- show up out of nowhere to ply my men with food and cricket --

#### GOVERNOR GRAHAM PETERS

Just one step to the left, Shaw, you're blocking my view.

##### [THE GOVERNOR'S VOICE IS FAMILIAR. VERY FAMILIAR.]

##### [HE SOUNDS LIKE... GAMMON?]

#### L.C. SHAW

-- and masquerading as a generous Governor will not make up for years of unequivocal incompetence followed by unexplained absence! 

#### GAMMON

I think I'm being plenty generous, considering you ransacked my house. 

#### L.C. SHAW

There was a rat infestation. We exterminated it. I am sorry that your walls now sport some bullet holes, but a gracious "thank you" would go a long way. 

#### GAMMON

And? Did you catch who you were looking for, Lieutenant-Colonel? 

#### L.C. SHAW

The needs of the crown come before any of its servants. A real governor would understand that. 

#### GAMMON

A "real governor"... So, in short, your brutish soldiers tore up my house and did not catch the rebel scum apparently occupying my estate. Sounds to me like you're in need of a governor like me.

##### [The ball hits the bat and it goes sailing across the lawn. There are cheers] 

#### GAMMON (CONT'D)

That's right, Georgie! You show those bastards how it's done! _(to Shaw)_ I'm done with you. You're dismissed. 

#### L.C. SHAW

You don't have the power to dismiss me, Graham. 

#### GAMMON

This is still my property, is it not, Shaw? 

#### L.C. SHAW

For now.

##### [L.C. SHAW leaves]

##### [GAMMON goes to drink from his teacup, but it is empty. He sighs -- his life is so hard... but spots a boy across the lawn.]

#### GAMMON

Here! You! Boy! You! Yes, you!

##### [SIVA arrives at a run] 

#### SIVA

How, uhm, can I help, sir? 

#### GAMMON

Pour the tea. And it's the *full* title when you address me. 

#### SIVA

...Sorry, sir -- 

#### GAMMON

Governor Peters, or Your Lordship. 

#### SIVA

Yes, your Lordship.

##### [SIVA pours him a cup of tea] 

#### GAMMON

New blood? 

#### SIVA

Er, yes, your Lordship. But, ah, my grandmother, she used to work for you. 

#### GAMMON

Keeping it in the family, eh.

#### SIVA

Did you know her, sir? Her name was --

##### [Across the lawn, the cricketer hits another 6] 

#### GAMMON

THAT'S IT, right over their heads! You enjoy the cricket, my boy? 

#### SIVA

...Yes, your Lordship. 

#### GAMMON

Friendly match, a single innings each, 20 overs max... I sure you haven't the foggiest what I'm saying, eh? 

#### SIVA

I grasp the basics, your Lordship.

##### [The bowler hits the wicket -- GAMMON groans] 

#### GAMMON

That's Lieutenant George out. Struggling a bit out here, poor fellow. I'm told he lost a limb in some dreadful attack by a pack of rabid pirates. 

#### SIVA

A pack of -- _(realisation)_ Oh. 

#### GAMMON

You needn't turn away like that, it's not as if he's grown a second bloody head! Look at the wind-up on that fellow. What I wouldn't give for arms like his. I suppose that's what you get being a soldier, eh? 

#### SIVA

My apologies, your Lordship, I have duties elsewhere... 

#### GAMMON

Nonsense. You're my boy, I tell you what your duties are. I used to be quite the batsman myself. Can't fathom playing out here, though, in this dismal heat. The boys must be sweating through their whites. Christ, I'm sitting in a puddle of the stuff and I'm just watching!

But we can't complain, can we. Not when we're just moments away from taking it all back. And then in just a few short weeks, we'll be back in the damp and the drizzle, reminiscing about the blasted sun!

##### [HE LAUGHS.] 

#### SIVA

Very good, Governor Peters. Will that be all, or... 

#### GAMMON

You're a very good listener, my boy. I like you. 

#### SIVA

Thank you, your Lordship --

#### GAMMON

AND THERE SHE IS, woman of the hour! 

#### ALESTES

...I see you've got a new boy. 

#### GAMMON

Come now, dear child, a "hello" won't do you any harm. 

#### ALESTES

This is private, dismiss the servant. 

#### GAMMON

No, no, I like him. He's my new confidante. 

#### ALESTES

Didn't you hear me? I said, go. 

#### SIVA

Uh, yes --

#### GAMMON

Whatever I hear, he hears. 

#### ALESTES

None of the locals wanted to talk. 

#### GAMMON

That's your confidential information? That you've gone soft? 

#### ALESTES

Whoever she is, she's got them all scared silent. 

#### GAMMON

My Alestes would have had this matter wrapped up in hours, not days. 

#### ALESTES

I am not and have never been "your" anything. 

#### SIVA

You know Governor Peters? 

#### ALESTES

"Governor Peters"? Jumping the gun, aren't we, Gammon? 

#### SIVA

*Gammon?*

##### [HE IS SUMMARILY IGNORED]

#### GAMMON

"Gammon," Alestes, really? It's not a kind nickname. You should know better than to hurt my feelings like that. 

#### ALESTES

Once your "Governorship" is reinstated, you can force me to call you whatever you want. 

#### GAMMON

We both know I've never been able to force you to do anything, my dear. 

#### SIVA

But if you're -- Gammon is the Governor? 

#### ALESTES

Not for a long time. 

#### GAMMON

No need to be so snide about it. 

#### SIVA

And you -- you're just sitting here -- drinking tea, and... watching the cricket. 

#### ALESTES

Your servant asks a lot of questions. He should know when to keep his mouth shut.

#### SIVA

Yes -- miss. 

#### GAMMON

Tea and cricket on the lawn is exactly where I should be. The rest is all necessity; a way to earn the life I deserve. 

#### ALESTES

As if you've ever gotten your own hands dirty. 

#### GAMMON

Come, Alestes! Let's not fight when we've barely seen one another in so long. Tell me. The turtles, how did they fare? Oh, don't look at me like that. Imagine my delight to hear you'd actually gone digging! I couldn't have asked for a better going-away present.

##### [ALESTES starts to draw her sword] 

#### GAMMON (CONT'D)

Ah-ah! You're surrounded by soldiers, my sweet girl. What a boring way to go. 

#### ALESTES

I've taken them before, I'll take them again. 

#### GAMMON

So much hurt pride over a harmless little prank. 

#### ALESTES

I'm going to kill you. 

#### GAMMON

No. You're not.

##### [GAMMON picks up a plate from the table. ALESTES'S plate.] 

#### GAMMON (CONT'D)

It looks like tat to me, but it must be important to you, to sell it for a slice of the quiet life. I'll return the plate, and I'll reinstate free trade in every port you're blacklisted in. All you have to do is tell me what you really found about this Johana woman. 

#### SIVA

Johana?

##### [A BEAT. HE REALISES HIS MISTAKE.]

Sorry. I-I'm needed in the kitchen now --

#### GAMMON

Don't move. Tell me. You know who Johana is? 

#### SIVA

I, uh.... 

#### GAMMON

Don't look at her, look at me. 

#### ALESTES

I'll take him inside and interrogate him. 

#### GAMMON

I don't have time for your tactics, Alestes. If you're going to make him talk, do it here. 

#### SIVA

Will you... will you really clear the Captain's name if I tell you? 

#### ALESTES

Han ji. [Translation: Potato/useless person]

#### GAMMON

...You don't work here, do you. 

#### SIVA

Promise me you'll give the Captain her, er, plate back, and I'll tell you everything you want to know about Johana. 

#### ALESTES

Think about what you're saying --

#### MARY

There you are. 

#### GAMMON

Not now, Mary. 

#### MARY

This is the one I was telling you about, Graham. With the maps. 

#### GAMMON

This is the cartographer? 

#### MARY

It is. 

#### GAMMON

...And why, pray tell, is the person upon whom our future hinges pouring my tea, Mary? 

#### MARY

He -- decided to go for a walk. 

#### GAMMON

"He decided to go for a..." Incapable of locking a bloody door now, are we? 

#### MARY

I did lock it, he --

#### GAMMON

Enough. I don't want to hear it. 

#### MARY

Don't you dare "enough" me. You may be able to silence your little pirate buddies, but you will not speak to me like that. 

#### GAMMON

I will speak to you however I wish, sister dearest --

And where the hell do you think you two are going? 

#### ALESTES

Sounded like you were in the middle of something. 

#### SIVA

Privacy is important when communicating --

#### GAMMON

Quiet.

You know, boy, I've been looking for you for a while, now. Your maps really are splendid. The level of detail in them -- and the quaint little personal touches! Doodles in the corners, grubby little curried fingerprints... so charming. And when I asked who made the map that nearly destroyed years of hard work, colour me shocked to find it was some schoolboy apprentice! The look on his useless face when Annie separated him from his precious moneymakers --

#### SIVA

Private Pearson -- no --! 

#### GAMMON

But now here you are, the real man of the match, another boy's fingers cleaved in vain! A shame, hm, stolen valour and all that. 

#### SIVA

I -- but -- why? It's just a map! 

#### GAMMON

Oh my dear boy, "just a map"? A map that shows every tactical retreat, every curve, every hill, every place to hide on my island? Thank God I was sleeping in my cabin on the other side of the world!

#### SIVA

_(realising)_ They used my map to organise the raid.

#### GAMMON

Well, of course! You did make it under the command of the Lieutenant-Colonel. 

#### SIVA

Not so they could -- I just like making maps! 

#### GAMMON

You created a tool of war and you're surprised it was fit for purpose? Tell me -- you honestly didn't know that Graham Peters and Captain Gammon were the same man? You didn't organise the raid to poison my name with the British? 

#### SIVA

No --

#### GAMMON

Do you work for Johana? 

#### SIVA

*No* --

#### GAMMON

But you do know her, and she hasn't told you. Which means either she doesn't know herself, or you're not high up in command.

See? Now we're in better territory. You're an excellent cartographer, and I'm not so egotistic that I'd kill a man of your talent without an offer first. Tell me what you know of Johana, and you can be my personal --

#### ALESTES

She was a servant. 

#### GAMMON

I'm trying to talk to the boy, Alestes. 

#### ALESTES

There was no grand plot to take you down, just some old, childless, busybody servant with nothing to do with her time but spy. 

#### GAMMON

...Go on. 

#### ALESTES

She created the Fly Fishers to seem bigger than herself. The locals say she died in the raid with the others. They weren't scared to talk, they just didn't care about what she was trying to do.

_(to Siva)_ They said that her rebellion died in this house along with her memory, and that it should stay that way. 

#### GAMMON

...It's a very convenient story if it's the truth. 

#### ALESTES

It is. 

#### GAMMON

And you know I'll be able to find you if it turns out you're playing games. Anything else?

#### ALESTES

That's it.

#### GAMMON

What an anti-climax. Here I was, hoping to choke the woman to death myself. 

#### SIVA

How can you say those things about --

#### ALESTES

Siva. 

#### SIVA

She wasn't just some --

#### ALESTES

Siva --

#### SIVA

No! 

#### ALESTES

We don't have time for this. Get your ass over here, we're leaving. 

#### SIVA

I... don't want to go with you. 

#### ALESTES

Siva, look at me. Come, now, or I'm leaving without you.

##### [SIVA takes a deep, shivering breath -- and starts to cry] 

#### GAMMON

Oh now, there's a precious fellow, has the scary woman made you cry? 

#### ALESTES

For crying out loud --

#### SIVA

I -- I need -- I need to think, I need --

#### GAMMON

I know exactly what you need. Some space and a nice cup of tea with someone who listens to you. Isn't that right, son. Take him inside, Mary. 

#### SIVA

...

##### [SIVA is led back inside by MARY] 

#### ALESTES

Siva. Siva, you take one more step and I'm not coming to save you again! 

#### GAMMON

It's always nice to find someone reasonable in this blasted place. They're gone. 

#### ALESTES

That pathetic, pissant tadpole! 

#### GAMMON

Enough entertainment for the day, I think! 

#### ALESTES

Go and die, Gammon. 

#### GAMMON

Oh, I nearly forgot! Your plate!

##### [GAMMON picks it up, then smashes it on the table] 

#### ALESTES

No --

#### GAMMON

I don't like punishing you, Miss Alestes, but you really do have to realise that your actions lead to consequences. Don't threaten me again. I'll be seeing you. 

##### [EXT. OUTSIDE GAMMON'S HIDEAWAY -- LATE AFTERNOON]

##### [In the forest -- hot, sweaty, insects buzzing] 

#### NOOR

Isn't that --

#### BAKER

*Alestes!*

##### [BAKER embraces her in a tight bear-hug] 

#### ALESTES

Get off, Baker. 

#### BAKER

We've been looking all over for you. You look ashen, are you injured? 

#### ALESTES

I'm fine. 

#### INEZ

You escaped? 

#### ALESTES

Something like that. 

#### NOOR

Did you see Siva in there? 

#### ALESTES

I'll tell you on the ship. 

#### NOOR

If he's in there, shouldn't we --

#### ALESTES

I said, let's go. 

#### BAKER

Let's all calm down, hey? Alestes, take a deep breath --

#### INEZ

...What did you do? 

#### ALESTES

Don't take that tone with me. 

#### NOOR

You left him there? 

#### INEZ

What did they want him for? More maps, or just another boy for their collection --

#### BAKER

Inez. 

#### INEZ

How much was he worth, huh? Gold? A private island? 

#### ALESTES

I didn't sell him. He chose to stay. 

#### BAKER

He... "chose" to stay? 

#### ALESTES

Do you have cloth for ears? Yes. He chose them. End of story. 

#### INEZ

Hah! Likely story! 

#### ALESTES

You shouldn't run your mouth about things you don't understand --

#### NOOR

We understand Siva, and he wouldn't abandon you for gold. 

#### ALESTES

Listen carefully. I've had a long day. Either you shut your mouths and sail away in silence, or you stay here making accusations, and we never see one another again. 

#### INEZ

...We're going to get Siva. 

#### ALESTES

Do whatever you want. Rush in there, ask him why he chose them over us. Ask him if he's the innocent little soul he's been pretending to be, and how long he thinks he can keep playing us. 

#### BAKER

"Playing us"? Alestes, what are you talking about? 

#### INEZ

She's just saying whatever makes her feel like less of an asshole --

#### ALESTES

Don't come running to me when you find out the truth, because my ship will be long gone. 

#### INEZ

You can't just -- All our stuff's on the ship! 

#### ALESTES

I'm the Captain. I can do whatever I want. 

#### INEZ

A Captain respects their crew. 

#### ALESTES

I don't have a crew. 

##### [SILENCE]

#### INEZ

Let's go. 

#### ALESTES

Where are you going, Noor? You still owe me five months' worth of labour. 

#### NOOR

The next time we meet, you may call that debt upon me. 

#### ALESTES

...Baker? 

#### BAKER

As you say, Alestes, you don't have a crew.

...But I do. If Siva's in trouble... then that's where I'm needed.

##### [THREE PAIRS OF FOOTSTEPS FADE INTO THE DISTANCE] 

#### ALESTES

_(calling after them)_ Fine! Get shot and die, all of you! See if I care! See if I --

##### [SHE CUTS HERSELF OFF -- SUDDENLY WRACKED WITH PAIN. HITS HER CHEST.]

#### ALESTES (CONT'D)

No. Not now.
