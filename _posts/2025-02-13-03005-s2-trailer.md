##### [Tape recorder clicks on]

##### [Wind whistling ominously: we're outside]

##### [Heavy boots approach]

#### DAVE

_(into radio)_ This is Delta team, sector 11 all clear, confirmed.

##### [The radio beeps in confirmation]

##### [Footsteps continue]

##### [A rustling sound behind them. They spin around, rifles drawn]

##### [Beat]

#### DAVE

...I've got nothing. 

#### HEIDI

Confirmed.

##### [More walking.]

#### HEIDI

Christ, I hate patrol. 

#### DAVE

Ha, this is nothing. You should've been here the first couple of years. Nasty business. 

#### HEIDI

That's what they tell me. Can't imagine it being that much worse, though, really. 

#### DAVE

_(chuckles)_ You've been here, what, a couple of weeks?

#### HEIDI

A month. 

#### DAVE

And you've had *how* many proper contacts? 

#### HEIDI

...What counts as a "proper" contact?

##### [Beat. She sighs.]

_(reluctantly)_ Just one. 

#### DAVE

Time was they'd be *every* other day, and that was just the ones we knew about. Still. You don't hear me complaining abou--

<!-- Time was they'd be every other day and that was just the ones we knew aboutStill, you don't hear me complainingHe stops abruptly, his flashlight catching on the tape recorder.  -->

##### [He stops abruptly]

#### HEIDI

_(panicked)_ What?! 

#### DAVE

_(flat, slow)_ I need you to tell me what I'm seeing. 

#### HEIDI

_(confused now)_ *What?* 

#### DAVE

Just do it. I -- want to be certain. 

#### HEIDI

Uh... okay. Er, looks like an cassette player. Pretty banged up. Er, do you want me t--

#### DAVE

No! No, no. Don't touch it.

...I was certain we'd got them all by now. Especially in this sector... 

#### HEIDI

Perhaps it's new!

#### DAVE

*God,* I hope not. That would be... Well, it might be nothing. Or it might be *very bad.*

#### HEIDI

So what do we do, smash it?

##### [Beat]

#### DAVE

Leave it. Note the location in the log and if it's still here when Echo team come through, well, then we start to worry.

##### [Footsteps as Dave starts to leave]

##### [Heidi lingers, writing in her clipboard]

#### DAVE

_(calling)_ Fall behind, left behind, rookie!

##### [Heidi gives a little frightened gasp and scarpers to catch up]

##### [Footsteps fade into the distance]

##### [Something scuttles close on two many legs, poking around the tape recorder]

##### [It suddenly flees, scared off by something]

##### [The wind continues howling, louder and louder, until it reaches a breaking point]

##### [The world *tears* --]

##### [And then a deep breath, and another:]

#### ARCHIVIST

YES. MORE.

##### [Click.]
