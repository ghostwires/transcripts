##### [SHOW THEME -- INTRO] 

##### [EXT. BEACH OF A SMALL ISLAND IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. MORNING.]

##### [A FEW MOMENTS OF THIS PEACE. AND THEN:]

#### ALESTES

COME ON, YOU MISERABLE WORMS, GET UP. Honestly, you haul one little boat to shore... 

#### NOOR

It was heavy, Captain. 

#### SIVA

I think I've dislocated my shoulder. 

#### INEZ

I can taste my own teeth.

#### ALESTES

Now -- "what are we doing on this shallow spit of land with nary a convenient mooring spot in sight?" I hear you ask.

#### INEZ

Developing a hernia?

#### ALESTES

My crew! Nay -- my friends --

#### INEZ

Susmaryosep... [Translation: portmanteau of Jesus, Mary, Joseph, with the meaning 'give me strength']

#### ALESTES

The day has come. The day me and you -- but mostly me -- have long dreamed of. For I have procured something very special indeed -- two somethings, in fact. Two very special somethings that will lead us... to TREASURE.

##### [WITH A FLOURISH, SHE PRODUCES TWO ITEMS FROM UNDER HER CLOAK.]

##### [THERE IS A LENGTHY SILENCE.]

#### SIVA

Are those... sea turtles? 

#### NOOR

I find your sense of humour perplexing at times, Captain -- 

#### ALESTES

It's not a joke! These are treasure-finding turtles.

##### [BEAT] 

#### INEZ

Noor, you pin her arms down -- Siva, look around for some vines or something --

#### ALESTES

_(talking over him)_ Using turtles to find treasure is a long and storied tradition amongst folk who sail under... certain flags. 

#### SIVA

Pirates! She means pirates! 

#### ALESTES

It is said --

#### SIVA

Because she used to be a pirate. 

#### ALESTES

It is said that a pair of mating turtles, fed a tiny nugget of treasure, will settle at the spot where gold is laid.

#### SIVA

Aw. Quite romantic, really. 

#### NOOR

But if what you say is true -- how is it that every sea from here to the Caribbean has not been fished dry of turtles? 

#### ALESTES

You can't just use any old turtle. 

#### NOOR

No? 

#### ALESTES

No. They have to be bonded, heart and soul, with the person who raised them. 

#### NOOR

...About those vines --

#### ALESTES

Two turtles fed with a tiny piece of gold on a pirate captain's lap will lead you to treasure, I've seen it! 

#### SIVA

You've... seen it? 

#### ALESTES

Saw the gold come out of the ground, plain as day. Glittering like a better tomorrow. 

#### SIVA

Well... I... suppose it's not... inconceivable that certain species of chelonioidea might develop sensitivity to... certain metals. 

#### NOOR

Stranger things have occurred in nature... salmon return to their native waters to spawn... dung beetles follow the path of the Milky Way... it could be scientifically... Inez?

#### INEZ

I think it's bollocks. 

#### ALESTES

Too bad I'm not giving anyone a choice. Let's split into two teams and take a turtle each, I suggest --

#### SIVA

I'll go with Noor! 

#### ALESTES

Right then. I suppose that leaves me and... 

#### INEZ

I'm not digging. _(leaving, calling back)_ And I'm not talking to a turtle either! Ooh, there had better be gold. 

##### [EXT. JUNGLE OF THE SAME SMALL ISLAND. MORNING.]

#### SIVA

...and then I'll buy a complete set of Encyclopaedia Britannica -- you know it's nearly twenty volumes now? I must confess, I do have a modest little daydream of one day contributing something to it myself, so I think owning it is a wise first step. That is, of course, if there's room for it in our house -- 

#### NOOR

"Our" house? 

#### SIVA

You, me, Alestes, Inez and Baker! We'll find a little cottage somewhere -- 

#### NOOR

Siva. If we really do find treasure, do you imagine Alestes will want to set eyes on any of us again?

#### SIVA

Oh. Well. No... no, of course, I suppose... but you and I could --

##### [HE STOPS ABRUPTLY, EMBARRASSED]

##### [STICKY INSECT HUM]

#### NOOR

It hardly matters. You know as well as I do that this plan is... dubious, to say the least. 

#### SIVA

Oh, but imagine, Noor! Imagine that we find the gold -- what would you do with your share? My guess is that you would buy yourself a boat and go sailing every day across the islands, and then in the evening bring back all manner of fascinating flora and fauna --

#### NOOR

Back to "our" house? 

#### SIVA

Well... yes. If -- if you want... 

#### NOOR

Siva... you know I -- I value your company but... 

#### SIVA

Look! Snails! 

#### NOOR

Ay. That boy. 

#### SIVA

These will make a fine addition to my collection! Do you see? Much smaller shells than the Architectonica -- from my reading, I believe them to be of the genus Helicarionidae -- of course I shan't know for certain until I'm back on the ship and can verify it in Mr Blair's book -- the most interesting thing about this family is their use of "love darts" during their courtships -- 

#### NOOR

You better go now! 

#### SIVA

...Go where?

#### NOOR

Back to the ship. To verify the snails. 

#### SIVA

But -- we're supposed to -- 

#### NOOR

I am capable of carrying out this wild goose chase on my own. I'm sure you could make better use of your time elsewhere. 

#### SIVA

But I don't mind -- 

#### NOOR

Siva, just go! 

#### SIVA

Yes. I see. Yes. I will -- take my leave. 

#### [SIVA LEAVES]

#### NOOR

Oh, Allah. Give me strength. 

##### [EXT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND. NOON.]

##### [ALESTES AND INEZ DIGGING]

#### INEZ

Anything? 

#### ALESTES

Not yet. 

#### INEZ

QuŽ sorpresa.

#### ALESTES

Look, it's here, alright? We just haven't... found it yet. 

#### INEZ

You'd be better off letting me have those turtles for my collection. 

#### ALESTES

You're not butchering them, Inez. 

#### INEZ

Conserving. I conserve animals. 

#### ALESTES

Either way, you're not having them. 

#### INEZ

What makes you so certain there's treasure on this island anyway? Alestes. Whose treasure are we looking for? 

#### ALESTES

_(mumbles)_ Gammon.

#### INEZ

What? 

#### ALESTES

Gammon! Alright? We're looking for Gammon's treasure, which is definitely on this island.

#### INEZ

Of all the... 

#### ALESTES

Now, before you go off on one -- 

#### INEZ

I don't know which stupidity to be angry at first! The fact that this is an obvious trap! Or the fact that if we did by some oblique chance find treasure belonging to a man nicknamed "Gammon," you'd be painting a target on our backs so wide it could be seen from the moon! 

#### ALESTES

It's here! And when we find it, we'll have enough riches to retire to a beach on the other side of the world before he knows it! 

#### INEZ

I can't believe you would be so stupid as to trust -- 

#### ALESTES

You don't know him! 

#### INEZ

Just misunderstood, is he? 

#### ALESTES

No, he's a rotten sack of potato mould masquerading as a man, but that's not the point!

...He likes me.

#### INEZ

He likes you? 

#### ALESTES

You wouldn't understand. 

#### INEZ

It's not me that has trouble comprehending human emotion, "Captain."

#### ALESTES

Ha! I've yet to hear a single personal fact about yourself! Siva's always going on about his Nani, even Noor tells stories about Aden, but you -- you seem to have sprung fully formed out of a pit of bile with no human attachment whatsoever! 

#### INEZ

You know nothing about my family. 

#### ALESTES

Go on then, what did the illustrious de Lunas do to fail to live up to your impossible standards? 

#### INEZ

My impossible standards? You expect us to work every hour of the day while constantly endangering our lives, not lifting a finger to help! 

#### ALESTES

Misdirection! 

#### INEZ

You know what? I will tell you one thing about my past: I thought my last master was the worst I could ever have. I was wrong. 

#### ALESTES

This is pointless. It must be further inland. 

##### [INT. THE GALLEY OF THE NETA. MIDDAY.]

#### SIVA

Sorry, sorry! Didn't mean to intrude. 

#### BAKER

No intrusion. I'm just writing. 

#### SIVA

I'll just go to my bunk and... 

#### BAKER

Anything you'd like to talk about, Siva? 

#### SIVA

No, no, I'll let you get on... 

#### BAKER

Are you sure? Because I can -- 

#### SIVA

Well, it's Noor! I don't understand it, really I don't -- I try and try, I bring them things, and they seem to like my company but then as soon as I press the point in any way they stop talking and tell me to go and do something else! I would be distraught to learn I was causing them any kind of discomfort and much of the time that does not seem to be the case but then they simply clam up out of nowhere and I... I don't know what to do.

#### BAKER

A heavy matter indeed. Unrequited love. 

#### SIVA

Well, I -- I don't know about love exactly, certainly I admire them -- 

#### BAKER

But they... don't always respond how you'd like? 

#### SIVA

That's exactly it. _(sighs)_ I'm at my wit's end. I'll just have to try something else. If only they would tell me what they want... 

#### BAKER

You know, I've been to a lot of places, and I hope to go many more before I pass on. But one thing has remained the same no matter where I travelled: people rarely say exactly what they want.

#### SIVA

But it would be so much easier if they did. 

#### BAKER

Of course. How can I explain? Ah -- who do you think I'm writing to? 

#### SIVA

I -- don't know. I suppose I've never considered that our crew might have attachments outside of the ship. 

#### BAKER

I'm writing to my husband. 

#### SIVA

Your -- husband? 

#### BAKER

Gabe. He's very far away from where we are -- he lives on land. Mi'kma'ki, although I suppose you might know it by the name Nova Scotia. 

#### SIVA

You have a husband in the Province of Canada? 

#### BAKER

I do. 

#### SIVA

But you've never mentioned him! 

#### BAKER

Sometimes we protect the things closest to our heart by not talking about them. 

#### SIVA

...Do you miss him?

#### BAKER

More than anything. 

#### SIVA

And... doesn't he miss you? 

#### BAKER

Oh yes. 

#### SIVA

Then why are you apart? If I was lucky enough to be with the one I loved... 

#### BAKER

Because people are complicated. And we don't always say what we want... 

##### [EXT. MI'KMA'KI. OUTSIDE GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.]

##### [GABE SINGING TO HIMSELF, THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR]

#### GABE

What in the world -- ? It's open! 

#### BAKER

Gabe. 

#### GABE

Baker? 

#### BAKER

There wasn't time to send word -- 

#### GABE

I thought you were... But you're fine. What do you want? 

#### BAKER

I -- I didn't come back for me.

#### GABE

Of course not. Why would you?

##### [BAKER REVEALS NDILISWA]

#### BAKER

...She needs help.

#### GABE

And who is "she"? 

#### BAKER

She -- 

#### GABE

The child can speak for herself. 

#### BAKER

No. She can't. Or... won't. That's the problem. 

...Put her in my bed. You remember where it is.

##### [BAKER TAKES NDILISWA TO THE OTHER ROOM AND RETURNS ALONE]

#### BAKER

She's out. Exhausted after the journey we had. 

#### GABE

She looks like she's been through a heap of something. 

#### BAKER

Hasn't said a word since I found her half drowned off the coast of Jamaica. Barely eats. It's like she's living but she's not... 

#### GABE

Alive. 

...What are you doing here, Baker?

There's a hundred spots between here and Jamaica you could have chosen to rest up. 

#### BAKER

...I couldn't... give her what she needed. And I thought maybe you...

I missed you.

#### GABE

I thought you were dead. 

#### BAKER

I'm sorry. 

#### GABE

Five years. 

#### BAKER

I'm sorry. 

#### GABE

Five years and not a word! 

#### BAKER

I'm -- 

#### GABE

If you say "sorry" again, I'll turn you out of the house right now! 

#### BAKER

I... yes.

##### [GABE BREATHES DEEPLY]

#### GABE

You know, I wasn't happy about you going, but I would have understood. I could see you needed to be... somewhere else. _(beat)_ Why didn't you talk to me? 

#### BAKER

Didn't know what to say. 

#### GABE

Well then. Guess there's not much to say now, is there? You can sleep on the floor. I'll make up a bed. 

#### BAKER

Gabe, please -- 

#### GABE

We can talk about what to do with this girl of yours in the morning. In the meantime, you'd better have a good hard think. 

#### BAKER

About what? 

#### GABE

How long you intend to stay. 

##### [INT. MI'KMA'KI. GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.]

#### GABE

That girl! She'll be the death of me! Or more likely -- someone else. 

#### BAKER

She didn't mean to -- 

#### GABE

She can speak for herself, thank you. Now -- Alestes. What have you got to say? 

#### ALESTES

_(sulky, teenage)_ He was being stupid. 

#### GABE

There are plenty of stupid people in the world, Alestes, we don't go holding their heads underwater! 

#### ALESTES

Why not? It's the quickest way. 

#### GABE

To do what? 

#### ALESTES

To stop them from being stupid again. 

#### GABE

_(trying not to laugh)_ You'll apologise and bring the boy's family a gift. Some of that salmon we smoked last week should do it. 

#### ALESTES

But *why?* 

#### GABE

Because other people are all we have. We look after our neighbours, and they look after us. 

#### ALESTES

But I don't need looking after. I can take care of myself just fine. 

#### GABE

Of course you can, Alestes. Nobody doubts how strong you are. How capable. But isn't it nice, sometimes, to have someone dote on you? To teach you how to smoke salmon, or to tell you stories? 

#### ALESTES

...I'd rather be making stories.

#### GABE

Oh yeah? Going to be an adventurer like my sweet seafarer? 

##### [GABE GIVES BAKER AN OVER-THE-TOP PARENTAL KISS]

#### ALESTES

Ughh! Fine! I'll go apologise, will that make you stop?!

#### BAKER

...Should we be worried, Gabe? Talking like that...

#### GABE

She'll be fine. She'll find the right place for herself. In time. 

##### [INT. MI'KMA'KI. GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.]

#### BAKER

...ten -- no, fifteen foot high at least! We saw the wave coming off the starboard bow and we were powerless to stop it -- I tell you, you don't know the sea --

#### GABE/ALESTES

_(chorusing together)_ -- until she's showed you the back of her hand.

##### [THEY LAUGH] 

#### BAKER

Told this one before, have I? 

#### ALESTES

Only every time there's a storm. 

#### BAKER

Well, that's the trouble with coming inland. You stop making new stories to tell. 

#### ALESTES

Do you think I'll ever get to make stories like yours? 

#### BAKER

If that's what you... 

#### GABE

I think we should all be making stories by going to bed and dreaming. Off you go, Alestes.

##### [ALESTES STARTS TO LEAVE]

#### GABE

And no reading into the small hours! 

#### ALESTES

'Course not, Gabe. Night, Baker. 

##### [ALESTES LEAVES]

#### BAKER

What's she reading now? 

#### GABE

Tales of the Deep. You know -- sea monsters, pirate ships... 

#### BAKER

I promise I didn't give it to her -- 

#### GABE

No, no. She picked it up in Halifax all by herself. She's... old enough to do a lot of things by herself now.

...Not much younger than us when we met. 

#### BAKER

That's different. 

#### GABE

How? 

#### BAKER

She's been through a lot, she -- 

#### GABE

She'll never put what she's been through behind her if she doesn't go out and start seeing the world herself. 

#### BAKER

What are you saying? 

#### GABE

You know as well as I do that she won't stay here hunting squid and squirrels her whole life. 

#### BAKER

She can't go out there on her own. 

#### GABE

I know.

...That's why you're going with her. 

#### BAKER

Gabe, no. 

#### GABE

Don't look at me like that. It's been -- more than I can say, having you both here with me. But I've seen the way your eyes sparkle when you're telling your old stories. I know she's not the only one that wants the chance to make more.

Am I wrong?

#### BAKER

...I can't abandon you again.

#### GABE

So this time it won't be an abandonment. You're going to take our girl into the world and show her what there is to be seen. And then -- you're going to sit down and write to me about it. 

#### BAKER

Write? 

#### GABE

Why do you think I spent so much time teaching you your letters? Not for my health, I can tell you that. 

#### BAKER

You said I was improving! 

#### GABE

And you're going to improve more by writing to me! Once a month, at least, and I want to know everything -- where you go, what you eat... how many boys Alestes beats up along the way... 

#### BAKER

You had this all planned out. 

#### GABE

Baby, the moment you stepped back in my home, I knew it wouldn't be forever. And that's alright. You need to be out there, same as I need to be here, with my school and my people. Just -- don't forget this time. 

#### BAKER

Forget what? 

#### GABE

That there are people here who love you. That this is home. 

#### BAKER

Gabe... 

#### GABE

Shush now. We've still got tonight at least... 

##### [INT. THE GALLEY OF THE *NETA.* AFTERNOON.]

#### SIVA

...how long since you've seen him?

#### BAKER

Going on a few years now.

#### SIVA

A few years? 

#### BAKER

I keep my promise. One letter a month, sometimes more.

#### SIVA

And that's enough?

#### BAKER

People are complicated, Siva. We need things that... don't always make sense. 

#### SIVA

I see. Or rather, I don't see and I'm not sure I ever will, but -- yes, I see. 

#### BAKER

Come here, lad. 

##### [BAKER PULLS SIVA INTO A BIG HUG.]

#### SIVA

Thank you Baker! 

#### BAKER

Now -- pass me that rice. Coming up on dinner time. 

##### [EXT. THE ISLAND. APPROACHING DUSK.]

##### [ALESTES AND INEZ DIGGING AS BEFORE, SLOWER NOW]

#### INEZ

Touch of pink on the horizon. 

#### ALESTES

Talking about the weather now, are we? Fascinating. 

#### INEZ

I'm saying it'll be dark within the hour. We should get back to the ship. 

#### ALESTES

Not stopping now. 

##### [INEZ THROWS DOWN THEIR SHOVEL]

#### INEZ

Oh, give UP, Alestes. We've dug holes all over this godforsaken rock and we've found exactly nothing. There isn't any treasure. There isn't any gold. He was toying with you.

#### ALESTES

No. There has to be. 

#### INEZ

WHY does there have to be?

Because he promised you? 

#### ALESTES

Because I -- Because I sold something important to him. The second we struck gold I was going to go back and exchange them. 

#### INEZ

What did you give him? 

#### ALESTES

None of your --

_(lying)_ ...Noor's bracelets.

#### INEZ

How desperate are you? 

#### ALESTES

What? 

#### INEZ

Anyone with half a brain could see that this plan had more holes in it than one of your pathetic fishing nets, yet you're so desperate to believe you can get lucky on some half-cocked fairy tale about sea turtles that you gamble away your crewmate's possessions? I've had enough. I'm going to find Noor and Siva and we're going to row back to the ship.

#### ALESTES

Fine, go. I'm not stopping until- 

##### [CLUNK! METAL HITTING SOMETHING BIG AND HEAVY AND WOODEN]

#### INEZ

What was that? 

#### ALESTES

I think -- I think -- 

#### INEZ

Was that --? 

#### ALESTES

Don't just stand there! Pick up your shovel and dig! 

##### [INEZ AND ALESTES DIG]

#### ALESTES

Yes, yes, get it out -- carefully... 

#### INEZ

You be careful. 

#### ALESTES

That's it -- Oh my god. 

#### INEZ

Oh my god. 

#### ALESTES

It's real. 

#### INEZ

I can't believe it. 

#### ALESTES

I knew it was real! I knew that old goat would never lie to me! 

##### [ALESTES LIFTS THE LID]

#### INEZ

What? What is it? 

#### ALESTES

No. 

#### INEZ

What's in there? Let me see. 

#### ALESTES

I don't -- it's not -- 

##### [INEZ LIFTS OUT A PIECE OF PAPER]

#### INEZ

It's just.. a note. Nothing else. (reading) "Better luck next time, kid. Love, Gammon. Kiss." 

#### ALESTES

I... he...

#### INEZ

It was a trick. 

#### ALESTES

He lied. 

#### INEZ

Just a dirty, rotten trick! 

#### ALESTES

He said -- he said -- 

#### INEZ

He said there was treasure! 

#### ALESTES

And I believed him! I believed him. What are you looking at? 

#### INEZ

Nothing. 

#### ALESTES

Go on then, fill your boots. Say "I told you so." Run off and spread the word that Alestes of the *Netaonasom* is the worst captain to sail the seven seas: a dupe, a fool, a naive idiot with gold in her eyes --

#### INEZ

...I don't reckon there's anything I could say that you're not saying to yourself.

#### ALESTES

We should get back. Baker wanted us to stop in at port on the way, check for letters. 

#### INEZ

Are you... alright? 

#### ALESTES

Nothing the sight of Gammon's blood on my sword won't fix. 

##### [INT. THE GALLEY OF THE NETA. EVENING.]

#### BAKER

Just in time! Food's on the table. Any luck? 

##### [ALESTES GRUNTS NO. SHE THUNKS THE TWO (DEAD) TURTLES ON THE TABLE]

#### ALESTES

These are for the pot. 

#### SIVA

Are those the turtles? 

#### INEZ

I want those shells once you're done with them. 

#### BAKER

Right. Of course. 

#### INEZ

We came back via port as you asked. 

#### BAKER

Anything for me? 

#### SIVA

Oh, you mean --! You mean any... interesting... messages... 

#### NOOR

Nothing for you, Baker. But Siva -- something for you. 

#### SIVA

What? Who could possibly -- what? Why are you smiling? 

#### NOOR

Why don't you take a look? 

#### SIVA

It's from... Mr Blair. He says... he says... my goodness. 

#### BAKER

Don't leave us in suspense, lad! 

#### SIVA

He says he might have found a position for me at the Queen's Museum. 

#### BAKER

Siva, that's wonderful!

#### NOOR

Isn't it! I hope you don't mind, the note wasn't sealed and Inez saw Mr Blair's signature so we snuck a peek and -- Mashallah! I'm so delighted for you!

#### INEZ

The Queen's Museum! That's not to be sniffed at. 

#### SIVA

...It's a dream come true...

#### INEZ

Then what's with the expression? 

#### NOOR

It's the opportunity of a lifetime, Siva. 

#### SIVA

Yes, I -- suppose it might be. Alest -- Captain. Could we make port at Kalitivu? Mr Blair says I can leave word of my response for him there. 

#### ALESTES

Headed that way anyway. Congratulations. 

#### BAKER

Are you sure nothing's wrong? 

#### ALESTES

Not now, Baker. 

#### BAKER

I take it today wasn't -- everything you hoped.

#### ALESTES

We need to alter course for Kalitivu. 

#### BAKER

Of course. Good of you to do that for Siva. 

#### ALESTES

Siva's news wasn't the only message waiting for us at port. 

#### BAKER

Anh...? 

#### ALESTES

Yes. My favour has come due.
