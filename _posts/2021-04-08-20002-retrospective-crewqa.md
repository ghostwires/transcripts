##### [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND, LIKE IN A WELL-TODO HOTEL RECEPTION]

##### [DING, DING]

#### LOWRI

Oh, I've been really looking forward to this break. 

#### HELEN

Me too! Spa or sauna first? 

#### LOWRI

Definitely the spa. 

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

#### JONNY

Can I help? 

#### HELEN

We'd like to check in, please? 

#### JONNY

Certainly. Your names then? 

#### HELEN

Helen Gould. 

#### LOWRI

Lowri Ann Davies. 

#### JONNY

Your passports, please. 

##### [PAPERS RUSTLE]

Thank you. And I just need to know a few details before we can assign a destination. 

#### HELEN

Destination...? 

#### LOWRI

Oh. 

#### JONNY

Could you please tell me your professions? 

#### LOWRI

Uh... 

#### JONNY

_(smoothly)_ It's for the system. 

#### HELEN

Right. Uh, I play Laverne, Melanie's therapist in *The Magnus Archives.* And I'm also the Lead Sensitivity Editor for Rusty Quill. So, I help come up with content warnings and things like that. 

#### LOWRI

And I am a producer at Rusty Quill for *The Magnus Archives.*

#### JONNY

Perfect. So Lowri, Helen, how did you get involved with Rusty Quill? 

#### LOWRI

I started working for Rusty Quill in 2017. So this is my fourth year, which is... yeah, a long time. I mean, I know it's not that long in the grand scheme of things, but it feels like a long time.

And I first got involved because I started doing an improv class, and one of the people in my improv class was Bryn Monroe, and he is a performer on *Rusty Quill Gaming.* And I was very into, like, podcasting and YouTube. I had a YouTube channel and a couple of podcasts I was doing with friends, and Bryn was like, very casual, like, "Oh yeah, I'm in a podcast. You know, it's an actual play podcast." And I was like, "Cool, I'll check that out."

And then came back the following week to the improv class, and was like, "I have listened to all sixty episodes that were available. I love it. It's so great." And then I just kept visiting the Rusty Quill website until they finally posted an ad for a producer. 

#### JONNY

And you? 

#### HELEN

I got involved with *The Magnus Archives* when I happened to arrive early to the studio for a *Rusty Quill Gaming* recording, and Alex just needed a quick voice to be Melanie's therapist. He was like, "We were hoping to save you for a bigger part at some point, but you can do these two lines. I'll just pitch you up, it'll be fine, people won't recognise you," but people who listen to *Rusty Quill Gaming* as well as *TMA* immediately clocked me because my name was in the credits. So that did not go as intended. _(chuckles)_

Then I started as Lead Sensitivity Editor around mid-September in 2020, and I got a lot more involved in behind the scenes stuff for *Magnus* and for Rusty Quill, in general, a lot more after that.

##### [CLOCK-LIKE SOUND TICKS AWAY IN BACKGROUND]

#### ANNIE

I have to think. I had something. I had something I had... Oh? Oh, hey, hey, what are you? Are you a, a tape recorder? Wow, what are you do--? Are you recording? Did I, did I start you? Did I start recording. Oh, oh, and you've, you've -- there's a, there's another one? This little f-friend. W-W-What do you have to say? 

##### [CLICK]

#### JONNY (TAPE)

Ah, there you are. It's time for you to remember for a moment. First, who are you? 

#### ANNIE

A-Annie. Annie Fitch. 

#### JONNY (TAPE)

And you work for Rusty Quill? 

#### ANNIE

A-Actually, I, I am, I'm an, I'm an audio editor with Rusty Quill working on *The Magnus Archives.* 

#### JONNY (TAPE)

When and how did you get involved with Rusty Quill or *The Magnus Archives?* 

#### ANNIE

So, I first got involved with Rusty Quill in 2019. At the beginning of the year, a friend of mine at my day job, he was -- he'd been trying to get me to listen to the show for over a year. And I finally caved, and we started listening to it together at work. I ended up shotgunning about the whole show up to current at the time, which was about 130 some, odd episodes, uh, in about six weeks.

At some point during Season 2, there was a baked-in ad of Ben saying that Rusty Quill was hiring. And so I thought, well, "That ad is old as dirt, but what the hell? I will go ahead and just send in my resume to that, and see what happens." And then I happened to get very lucky, and there was a hiring wave that came immediately following that. Like, about a month later, they sent out emails.

##### [SOUNDS OF ROWING AND WATER]

#### NICO

Ah, can't thank you again for picking me up. Thought I'd be stuck here forever. 

#### JONNY

Hmm. My pleasure. It's such a lovely day to be on the water, but I must ask, who are you? 

#### NICO

Oh, uh, not a problem. I'm Nico. I work for Rusty Quill. I work in *The Magnus Archives,* Season 5, vocal cut editor, mouth sound remover extraordinaire. 

#### JONNY

And how did you get involved with this... Rusty Knife? 

#### NICO

_(chuckles)_ Rusty Quill. Year is 2016. I emailed that there Rusty Quill, it was like, "You want any custom music?" And they're like, "No, don't need any custom music, cos we already got music, but we're gonna keep your information on file." So they kept it on file, three years go past, and like, Hannah came back, did the whole interview thing, did the auditiony thing, and then I was on *Outliers* first. Did a bit of soundscaping for *Rusty Quill Gaming.* And then Alex is like, "Which one of the shows do you wanna do?" I was like, "Well, I quite like *Magnus Archives.*"

Truth be told, I chose *The Magnus Archives* because it had the best cover art out of all of them. Controversy, I know. And if it's not your favourite, I'm sorry. Hadn't read anything about *The Magnus Archives,* had no idea what the plot was.

So the first thing I actually did in *The Magnus Archives* was the fluff episodes. The fluff episodes are, like, based in Season 1 and Season 2, and are fan-written submissions. Non-canonical. Nice, lovely... loveliness. There's no spooky, spooky eldritch horror, doomed in it. And that gave me a __very__ warped perception of The Magnus Archives. Like I'm talking, _(whistles cheerfully)_

So, you can imagine going from that into 167, which was my first episode I did, where it __is__ Season 5, eldritch horror, all _(weird mouth sound)_... Yeah.

#### ELIZABETH

Hello, is there anyone here?

I'm getting pretty bored!

Okay, this isn't funny anymore.

First window I see, I'm just going to smash this sh--Hey, is that a tape recorder? 

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

And these are... these are questions. 

##### [PAPER RUSTLES]

Okay, so I answer the questions, the next thing happens, yadda, yadda, I get out. Okay, I can do this.

Right. My name? My name is Elizabeth Moffatt. That's with two T's.

So, profession? Okay. So... I've been a sound editor for *The Magnus Archives* since the end of Season 2, um, through to the end of Season 5, uh, and in Season 5, I was doing the sound design side of things.

And how did I get involved? Uh, okay, so that's simple. Um, I was a fan of the show towards the end of 2016, and in 2017 when Rusty Quill started advertising for new staff, I applied. And, so I was part of a group that included Brock [Winstead] and James [Austin] who were brought on. And I think the other side of that is also, why have I stayed? In reality that comes down to the fact that after James left to open his own business, Alex really insisted that me and Brock sign a blood pact, that we'd only be able to leave once the last episode of *Magnus* went out.

And I'm pretty sure I can mention that now, because it's not covered by the NDAs anymore.

##### [HOTEL MUZAK RESUMES]

#### JONNY

Have you ever had any spooky or supernatural experiences? 

#### LOWRI

So the only spooky or supernatural experience I can remember was when I was very young, and I remember one night I woke up, and there was just a really bright light outside the window and, like, shadows moving up and down. And... I, I don't remember being that scared. I do remember saying to myself, "Okay, it's just the trees, you know, it's fine." And then I went to sleep, and it's not that I forgot about it, but I didn't really think about it. And it wasn't until years later that I was like, "Hang on a minute... there were no trees outside that window. That window overlooked, just next door's wall." Like, their garden, really high garden wall and their house. There was nothing that could move there.

So I don't know what that was, but, uh, I don't like thinking about it.

##### [CLICK]

##### [TICKING RESUMES]

#### ANNIE

I have had a supernatural experience. Uh, I work at my day job, I work at a theme park as an audio engineer and an entertainment technician. And, um, we run a major Hallowe'en event every year where we build up a bunch of haunted houses or haunted house-like attractions that we call mazes all throughout the park.

One of these mazes takes place in a defunct IMAX theatre that we have on the property that hasn't been in operation in, I think at least fifteen years, maybe more like twenty. So, sort of in the space between the seats and the screen at the front, we built the indoor portion of this maze. My first year at the park, back in 2013, the maze we had in there, there was one particular room that was a series of mannequins hanging from the crossbeams of the maze that we built, by ropes. They were like soft foam mannequins that you had to push your way through. Very creepy stuff, made all the more creepy by the fact that these are the most hyper-realistic mannequins you can possibly envision. They were made from a plaster cast of a person who I actually work with at the park. And these were, when they were brand, brand new, fresh out of the mould, just hung in the room, they hadn't taken any damage yet. So it was very, very unnerving to be anywhere near these mannequins.

So one day I am with a smaller crew of people, we're working at the back of the theatre to remove some seats that were still in the theatre, we're unbolting them from the ground and bringing them over to another maze to use as a prop. So my co-workers leave, because the truck that we're carrying the stuff in it only has so many seats, so I, I ended up being the odd one out, and I'm like, "Cool, whatever, free break, you know."

So I hang back at the theatre while they go to unload those seats. And I'm standing at the back, and I look over at the hanging bodies room. Now, bear in mind, this is the middle of summer in California. It's like 90 some odd degrees [90°F = 32°C], no wind. I'm looking down there, and all of a sudden, all the mannequins, they start to just, sort of, gently sway a little bit.

And, as I said, I don't believe there was any breeze and they're just kind of swaying there. And there's this one particular mannequin that's facing almost directly away from me. And then, as all these mannequins start to sway together as though in a breeze, even though I felt no breeze, the one that's facing away from me begins to slowly rotate counter-clockwise, and it turns, and it turns, and it turns about 100 to 120 degrees around until it's facing directly at where I'm standing. And then all at once, they all just stop moving. They all stop swaying in the breeze. So I said, "Nope. Okay. Point taken, I'll go stand outside." And I did. I went and I waited outside for my co-workers to show back up.

And to this day I do everything in my power to avoid going in that building by myself. There have been other things that have happened in that building both to me and other people. So I just try not to go there.

##### [GRINDING SOUNDS CONTINUE]

#### ELIZABETH

So I haven't had any supernatural experiences myself, but I have been around them when they've happened to other people. I went on a ghost hunt with two friends, Erica and Maria, not their real names, and we were in a boarding school, quite an old one, which had a history of hauntings. And I know Maria felt in one room that there was something touching her legs, sort of climbing up her leg in some way.

Meanwhile, in another room, in the basement, Erica felt this draft against her neck and her face, which wasn't coming from anywhere natural, like a door or a window. I personally didn't experience anything supernatural. And that's really because I was the one doing those things to the other two. So yeah, wasn't gonna...

I guess I'm more of a supernatural causer than a supernatural receiver in that sense.

##### [MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE LAKE]

#### JONNY

Do you engage with horror as a genre? 

#### NICO

You know, I do engage with horror as a genre. Like, I've platinum trophied *Bloodborne.* I played half of the first *Resident Evil,* didn't even bother with 2 or 3, that was a bit too scary for me back in the day. So yeah, I'd say I proper do engage with horror as a genre. 

##### [CLICK]

##### [HOTEL MUZAK GOES ON AND ON]



#### LOWRI

Do I engage with horror as a genre? So... honestly, no. And the reason for that is I'm just a big scaredy cat. The actual watching of the thing, or the reading, or the listening to the horror, I do enjoy that. Like, I enjoy the whole, the dread and all of that. But I get horrific nightmares, like really, really terrible... I-It's almost like lucid dreaming, sleep paralysis, nightmares. Triggered by scary things, unsurprisingly, and yeah, when I get into those cycles, it just, it just has a really negative impact on my life. So yeah, I tend not to really engage with horror, which was a bit tricky for *Magnus.* 

#### HELEN

I __love__ horror. It's my favourite genre to engage with. Regardless of quality. I will never watch a badly-reviewed romcom, but I will happily sit down for, like, a onestar horror movie. One of my favourite things to do as a treat was get dinner at Nando's and then go and watch an awful horror movie. It helps me to manage my anxiety, to be able to focus on fictional scary things rather than real scary things.

And on a, like a, a genuine intellectual level, I think that horror is one of the most interesting genres that you can work in. You can do a hell of a lot of complex stuff with it, and I really enjoy that variety. 

##### [CLICK]

##### [CLICK]

##### [BACK TO THE GRIND]

#### ELIZABETH

So I think it's very hard not to engage with horror if you read or watch or listen to anything particularly interesting, because even if you're not engaging with just pure horror, other genres always tend to use it in some element. I think most of my engagement has been with books. I really remember as a kid being with my friend on my brother's bed, while we read his copy of *The Usborne World of the Unknown* book about ghosts, and really just screaming our heads off when the cat jumped on the bed.

I also really remember the public library that I used to go to when I was a kid, it had a kid's wing and then it had the adult's wing. But they just let you use your library card in either. So I used to go over and find the books in, apparently, the post-apocalyptic section and read a lot of stuff, which nowadays, I think probably was more scarring than anything else. Um, and one of those books was *I Have No Mouth But I Must Scream.* And that was probably when I was about 10.

And that was the thing. It was like, I wasn't searching for horror, but there was always content that you read, if you read enough, there's always going to be horror inside of it. 

##### [CLICK]

##### [KEEPS ON TICKING]

#### ANNIE

I tend to only engage with horror as a genre in very specific ways. I don't like horror movies. There are very, very few horror movies I actually like, either because they're not scary to me or they're just gross. I really, really enjoy audio horror and written horror, because I find horror is most effective, it's scariest and it's most interesting, and it makes you think the most, when an author can allow you as the reader or the listener, as the audience, to fill in the blanks with the scariest version of the thing that they're describing for you, take their parameters and fill in the blanks with what scares __you__ most.

##### [MORE MUZAK]

#### JONNY

What's your personal fear or nightmare? 

#### HELEN

I have lots and lots of different personal fears, and I often have very vivid dreams. So, um, this question is very difficult to answer succinctly. My biggest personal fear on a realistic level is watching somebody I love slowly lose their memories and lucidity. And my biggest personal fear on like a silly, unrealistic level, is being put in a metal box and then the metal box being put on a fire.

Um, the last nightmare that I had, that I really remember was, uh, I was just trying to get on with my normal life, but there were spiders, just jumping at me constantly for no reason. Like my brain gave me literal jump scares because it likes to do these things to me. 

#### LOWRI

_(sighs)_ I, I don't think claustrophobia is the right word, but I really, really hate being restrained. And I mean, actually, yeah, being like, you know, the thought of being buried alive is just, "Oh my gosh, so awful." Uh, I think it also comes down a bit to lack of control. I don't like not having control. 

##### [CLICK]

##### [CLICK]

##### [TICKS CONTINUE]

#### ANNIE

My biggest fear, my personal biggest fear is actually quite well covered by the show. Uh, it's episode 170 [MAG170 -- *Recollection*]. Um, cos my greatest fear is, sort of, the oblivion of the self, is forgetting who you are, forgetting loved ones, forgetting friends, just sort of fading away and not remembering who you are. And that, that also includes the idea of the finality of death, like, like, nothing being afterwards. No, no continuation of consciousness, no afterlife, no reincarnation, no, nothing. The idea that when we die, that's it. There's nothing else there, that is, like, paralyzingly terrifying to me. So episode 170 kind of covers all of that. Just the, the loss of, the loss of oneself. Easily my biggest nightmare.

##### [GRINDING AWAY]

#### ELIZABETH

So I think I'm like a lot of people, I have a lot of rational fears, and then a couple of pretty irrational ones. And the top of those is a strong fear of accidentally teleporting myself to a planet. And in particular, teleporting myself to Jupiter, and plummeting through a cloud of, like, oxygen until I hit something else, like ammonia, or I get completely crushed by gravity.

So my upbringing is to blame for this because we had a lot of astronomy books in our house. And we had a book which had all these full colour images from the Voyager missions, which included, like, close-ups of Jupiter and the red storm. The weird thing is, I suppose, that I still really like things to do with astronomy. So I'll often go to a planetarium, and then halfway through whatever we're watching, kind of break out into a cold sweat, because I'm at the point where I think I'm going to accidentally transport myself to whatever black hole they're talking about.

But I still want to be there to watch it all. So...

##### [ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR EDITOR...]

#### NICO

I have a fear of drowning, especially, like, in video games. You laugh, I can hear you laughing, but it's true. Like, when you play *Fallout,* when you have to go on the underwater bit to find a submarine, or when you play in *Subnautica,* not so much the water levels in *Zelda,* because that's a bit cartoony and whatnot. But like, for me, I can physically feel it, the murkiness and urgh. It's like how people talk about the soundscapes and The Buried episodes make them feel very claustrophobic, like it physically hits them. That's how I feel when I do water levels in video games.

#### JONNY

What's your favourite or funny memory of being involved in *Magnus?* 

#### HELEN

The dozens of times I've been, like, "Okay, uh, we need a warning for apocalypse, for murder, mass suffering, body horror, including sound effects.

"Ooh, and strong language."

#### LOWRI

With the Skype recordings, I would sit in on the Skype recordings, so like, make sure everyone got there. And like, sometimes we'd record the, the Skype video and things like that. And it was so lovely just watching everyone work, I guess.

And also something that has been really, really lovely is -- oh, this is so, like, sappy, but I've really enjoyed our weekly meetings, like me, Jonny, Elizabeth, and sometimes Alex, cos he's a very busy man, uh, would have, you know, just meetings to check that everything's going right, check in with each other to see if there are any problems or things that we need to address, and, yeah, that was just, just real nice. It's real nice.

Definitely getting to work with Lowri and Jonny on Season 5 has been great. Um, and also that other one that sometimes attends the meetings. Can't remember his name.

And because in 2020, we were all basically trapped inside, we socialised through gaming. So I think my favourite memory there is just Helen pushing me into a ravine to my death. Accidentally, she reckons.

##### [TICKING CONTINUES]

#### ANNIE

One time, very early on in my editing, there was a time where Alex and Jonny were talking out-of-character about something. And basically they were making some kind of joke at the vocal editors' expense, some kind of "eff you" thing, just like in a light-hearted and like jokey way, obviously. And then Alex goes, "Oh, actually, hang on. I think... I don't know who's editing this one. I think it might be Annie. I don't know how she feels about, like, being talked to like that" and everything. But, of course, here I am on the other end of receiving this recording, editing it, absolutely losing it, just cracking up.

##### [EXTENDED SOUNDS OF ROWING]

#### NICO

My favourite memory of *The Magnus Archives* is 186. 186 is the *Quiet* episode, where it's Martin and Other!Martin. It was about two and a half hours of raw recording of Alex going from very confident and self-assured and very "I'm gonna be able to do this, whack it out one thing." And it was the slooooooow descent into madness.

There's one point in it, about two hours in, where he needs to have a rest, but he's not cos he's, he's ploughing through, when he need to get a drink of water, and he has, for some odd reason, he's got a screwdriver in the recording room, like a, a drill. And, uh, he realises it makes a sound, and then it's just him going, "whirr, whirr, I am a robot, whirr, whirr," and then he cracks on straight into being Martin again, doing like one of the most dramatic speeches Martin's ever done about, you know, hating his mother, and it's like, wow, the whiplash.

#### JONNY

What is something you wish everyone knew about working on *The Magnus Archives?* 

#### HELEN

There's probably, like, about 10 people involved in every single episode. And that's not really including the actors, cos you've got Alex and Jonny and like, three different layers of audio editors. And then you've got me and the Comms Assistant listening to it. And then you also have Anil listening to it. And then you've got, like, all the different management stuff, like the admin stuff that needs to happen. So like, people to be told what's going on. So like, there's just a ton of people involved and they all really do their best. And I love them all very much.

So I just want people to know how well Lowri and April and Alex and everyone else in the company did, um, just pivoting when we had COVID hit. Um, not just for *The Magnus Archives,* but obviously we had *Stellar Firma* and *Rusty Quill Gaming.* And a huge part of that is really because we just have so much fan support, which, can't thank the fans enough for.

And also I absolutely adore all the fanart. Just keep it coming for the rest of time.

##### [RETURN TO THE TICKING]

#### ANNIE

Everybody who worked on it would just kind of go off on one in between takes, all the weird conversations, all the rants. So, uh, just a couple examples off the top of my head. Jonny used to have one-sided conversations with the editors, whenever Alex would leave the room, whenever he would be the only one on mic, he would be like, "Yo, how's your day going? Yeah. You know, I'm hanging in there."

On one of these occasions he offered me an in on his sock-based pyramid scheme. Another time Jonny, Alex, and a guest spent an incredibly long time talking about memes and trying to explain memes to each other, that they felt they were too old to understand. And then somehow they got on the subject of Waluigi. And then from there, it devolved into the three of them and, I kid you not, making a fan cast of the musical *Les Misérables* using entirely Muppets and Mario characters.

It was a really, really weird experience, but it was a great, great way to spend a break during an edit.

#### NICO

Oh, hype! Hype is something I want people to know about on *The Magnus Archives.* Cos it trickles down. Think about it. You got Jonny writing the scripts, Alex looks at it, he changes, edits, you know, what have you. And then, they're the only people I know, then it gets trickled down to upper management, upper, like head producer, Lowri producer, you know. And then it gets released to us editors. And then we're just, like, losing our minds because it's like, _(gasps)_ new scripts have been released, and we're frantically reading these scripts.

And then, because we barely know anyone else who also knows it, cos, you know, we can't just sort of get Barbara down the street and just chat to her about it because of NDAs and whatnot. Plus you don't want to ruin *The Magnus Archives* for Barbara.

So it's just me screaming to Annie. And Annie screaming to me, and it's like that for a while, whilst we're producing the episode, and then there's a long wait. And then the episode gets released, and it's just, it's a whole circle of hype. 

#### JONNY

You don't say...

Well, this has been an enjoyable conversation, but I'm afraid this is actually your destination.
