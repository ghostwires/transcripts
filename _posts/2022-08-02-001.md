##### [SHOW THEME - INTRO] 

#### SIVA

Rusty Quill Presents: *Trice Forgotten.*

Episode One: The First Blow.

##### [THEME KICKS UP: LIVELY-YET-SAD PLUCKED STRINGS, ACCOMPANIED BY THE TRILLS OF A FLUTE]

##### [THEME FADES OUT]

##### [WAVES CRASH; A STORM BLOWS] 

#### NDILISWA

Appa...

#### ZHU ANRAN

Jump, Ndiliswa, go!

#### NDILISWA

Appa!

##### [BANG LIKE CANNON FIRE. WOOD CRACKS AND SPLINTERS]

##### [LARGE SPLASH; NDILISWA COUGHS UP WATER, THEN GOES UNDER]

#### ZHU ANRAN

_(further away)_ Ndiliswa!

##### [DESPERATE OCEANIC THRASHING]

#### ZHU ANRAN

_(muffled, now)_ NDILISWA!

##### [SWIRLING UNDERWATER NOISES FADE TO A LOW HUM]

##### [INSECTS BUZZING]

##### [WE ARE IN A MEMORY]

#### ZHU ANRAN

_(gentle, with the cadence of a bedtime story)_ The golden carp swims upriver! See? Around the rim, _(makes tapping noises)_ climbing, climbing...

##### [NDILISWA GIGGLES]

Knowing he'll become a *dragon* when he reaches the gate. That is, until he sees the red carp -- clothed in rich Xhosa ochre... a truer treasure indeed. And, married now, *incebetha* pinned with beads, on the patterns of this plate the lovers swirl and swirl...

##### [BRUSHING AGAINST CERAMIC] 

Destiny changed, until they bear their own little carp.

##### [THEY LAUGH TOGETHER. ZHU ANRAN, IMPROVISING, SINGS:]

Hey, hey, little carp  
Flying through the river there  
Watch how she swims

Underneath sun-warmed streams  
Dazzling collar made from beads  
Dancing, dancing, dance upstream

Face painted white and gold  
Over cheeks and above eyes  
Dancing, dancing, dance upstream

##### [UNDERWATER NOISES INTENSIFY. ZHU ANRAN'S VOICE FADES SLOWLY]

Watch how she swims  
Dancing, dancing, dance upstream  
Dancing, dancing, dance upstream  
Dancing, dancing, dance up...

##### [NDILISWA IS LIFTED, AND SOUNDS ARE SUDDENLY CRISP]

##### [WE'RE MID-HURRICANE -- HEAVY RAIN POURS, WIND HOWLS, AND WAVES CRASH]

##### [NDILISWA COUGHS UP SEAWATER AND GULPS AIR]

#### BAKER

I've got you, child, I've got you!

##### [NOISES OF EFFORT]

_(muffled)_ Hold on. Hold on!

##### [SILENCE; THEN RAIN FADES IN]

##### [STEADY FOOTSTEPS ACROSS WET GROUND AS THE HURRICANE RAGES]

##### [BAKER POUNDS RHYTHMICALLY ON A DOOR] 

#### BAKER

Please! Please, I have a child!

##### [POUNDS AGAIN]

Please!

##### [THE DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

#### ELIZABETH

Put the child on the bed. You go stoke the fire.

##### [DECISIVE DOOR CLOSING, AND THE HURRICANE IS MUFFLED]

##### [A FIRE CRACKLES; FOOTSTEPS; BAKER STOKES THE FIRE] 

#### ELIZABETH

Your child? 

#### BAKER

No, -- _(he stops himself)_

#### ELIZABETH

"Doctor." 

#### BAKER

No, Doctor, found half-drowned, checking the moorings. 

#### ELIZABETH

Whale boat? 

#### BAKER

Yes, Doctor. 

#### ELIZABETH

You got no surgeon aboard? 

#### BAKER

We do, but... 

##### [BEAT]

#### ELIZABETH

No love of people our shade. Hmph.

You're new here.

#### BAKER

Just docked. 

#### ELIZABETH

How did you find me? 

#### BAKER

If it's about the money --

#### ELIZABETH

_(hard)_ Is that what I asked you?

##### [TAP ON METAL. BEAT.]

There are a dozen doctors in Kingston, all of them three miles closer to the shore.

#### BAKER

_(long sigh)_ I was recommended.

##### [FABRIC NOISES AND WOODEN CREAKS] 

#### ELIZABETH

I can go back to bed and not lose a wink of sleep, stranger. _(warning)_ Don't be vague. 

#### BAKER

I was told, _(takes a breath)_ if I ever needed help round these islands, to come find Doctor Elizabeth. 

#### ELIZABETH

I don't do favours for just anyone that knows my name. 

#### BAKER

I have the money, please!

#### ELIZABETH

_(last chance)_ Who was it that told you to come looking for me? 

#### BAKER

Gabe. Gabriel Grant. 

##### [PAUSE]

#### ELIZABETH

And what's Gabriel Grant doing giving my name out to a whaler? 

#### BAKER

Please, Doctor -- once you've tended the child, I will answer *any question!*

#### ELIZABETH

Last I heard, baby Gabe was going to try his luck in Nova Scotia. 

##### [PAUSE, AGAIN]

#### BAKER

_(correcting)_ Mi'kma'ki. 

#### ELIZABETH

_(conceding)_ ...Mi'kma'ki.

He made it? 

#### BAKER

He did.

He's a teacher. 

#### ELIZABETH

And he's close enough he'd give you my name?

##### [BAKER CONSIDERS ELIZABETH FOR A MOMENT.]

#### BAKER

My husband didn't want me to die on this voyage. 

#### ELIZABETH

*Husband?!*

_(with an undercurrent of delight)_ Nobody tells Elizabeth nothin' these days. Damn children, forget the folks who raised them.

##### [FOOTSTEPS. ELIZABETH FINALLY STARTS COLLECTING HERBS AND POTS.]

What's your name, cousin?

#### BAKER

Baker.

The child, are they -- 

#### ELIZABETH

Regular breaths, good sign. No gashes, some bumps and bruises. _(pouring something)_ Drowning's a nasty thing, and in this God-awful hurricane, too. I'd say you got the child just in time.

##### [NDILISWA BREATHES SHARPLY, WHIMPERS]

Not seen this one around before. Washed up alone? 

#### BAKER

Alone. 

#### ELIZABETH

Alright. You know your way around a mortar and pestle, cousin? 

#### BAKER

Yes, Doctor. 

#### ELIZABETH

Then let's save ourselves a child, cousin Baker.

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC FADES IN, SLOW, CONSIDERING]

##### [MUFFLED, THE LAPPING OF A CALM SEA, THE CREAKING OF WOOD, THE SQUAWK OF SEABIRDS]

##### [PACING. A KICK.]

#### ALESTES

Empty. _(louder)_ Empty, empty, *empty.*

_(her voice cracking)_ A ship of my own. And every chest, _(kick)_ crate, _(kick)_ and *goddamned barrel* -- _(kick)_ empty.

##### [PACING STOPS]

##### [A FINAL, HARD KICK]

*Aaargh!*

##### [SOMETHING SHATTERS]

This is not where it ends!

##### [SHE OPENS SOMETHING. THE WAVES SWELL OVER A LIGHT JANGLING OF COINS]

Barely enough for supper.

_(putting on a snooty merchant voice)_ "This? *Very clearly* an imitation, and a poor one at that. I won't go higher than an escudo."

_(scoffs to herself)_ An escudo? That set was worth a crate of gold, the *thief.* As if I don't know my pearlware!

And now not even a rat would stow away.

##### [KICK. A THUMP FROM A BARREL, VERY MUCH NOT EMPTY.] 

#### SIVA

_(muffled)_ Ow --!

##### [A FRIGHTENED SQUEAL; SIVA CUTS HIMSELF OFF]

##### [THE DRAWING OF A SWORD, SLOW, MALICIOUS] 

#### ALESTES

Three seconds, rat. *Three.*

##### [SILENCE] 

*Two.*

##### [SILENCE]

Do not make me --

##### [SIVA CLAMBERS HURRIEDLY OUT]

#### SIVA

Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Peace -- I come in peace, please! Amnesty! _(desperately searching for the right word)_ Uhm, parley?! *Surrender!* I surrender.

##### [SIVA SQUEAKS AS ALESTES GRABS HIM, PULLS HIM FULLY FROM THE BARREL -- AND DROPS HIM TO THE FLOOR.]

#### ALESTES

_(hard)_ You squawk too much for a rat.

#### SIVA

Yes --! Sorry. I'm rather nervous, due partly, or mostly, in fact, because of the sword that is very, *very* close to my neck, and that is, unfortunately, making me feel -- uhm -- quite -- uhm -- terrified.

#### ALESTES

Did *he* send you?

##### [BEAT]

#### SIVA

Being that I am not entirely sure I know who "he" is, I'm going to hazard a guess that that would be a no...?

##### [ALESTES WATCHES SIVA FOR A LONG BEAT.]

##### [THE SWORD IS SHEATHED.] 

#### SIVA

Oh good God, mercy, thank you --

#### ALESTES

Out. Now.

#### SIVA

Ah, well, I --

##### [ALESTES SHOVES HIM TO MAKE HIM WALK; FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE OVER THEIR CONVERSATION]

#### ALESTES

Get *off my ship* before my patience really runs out!

#### SIVA

No, see, my name is Siva! Sivapathasundaram.

#### ALESTES

Up.

#### SIVA

I am a cartographer!

#### ALESTES

*Climb!*

##### [THUMPS OF CLIMBING UP THE LADDER] 

#### SIVA

A good one, and I really need to leave here -- this island, and --

#### ALESTES

We're *not hiring.*

##### [THE WAVES, WIND AND SEABIRDS ARE LESS MUFFLED. THE SHIP CREAKS.]

##### [BAKER PERKS UP WITH A YAWN.]

#### BAKER

_(groggy)_ Who's that?

##### [HE SOUNDS NOTICEABLY OLDER THAN WHEN WE LAST HEARD HIM.]

#### ALESTES

Do *not* make eye contact. *Either* of you.

#### BAKER

_(concerned)_ What were you doing down in the hold?

#### ALESTES

_(knows where this is going)_ No, Baker. Do not engage --

#### SIVA

Hello! I'm --

#### ALESTES

_(warning)_ Ah, ah, ah --

#### BAKER

Are you in need of assistance, child?

#### SIVA

Siva! My name is Siva, and --

#### BAKER

Alesteeees... 

#### ALESTES

*No,* Baker. 

#### SIVA

I can work, Sir, I swear --

#### ALESTES

Work?! I've seen beansprouts with more muscle on them. 

#### SIVA

I-I promise, you won't find maps of this area finer than mine.

#### ALESTES

If you're as skilled as you say, you wouldn't need to hide in my hold, would you. 

#### SIVA

_(small laugh)_ To be honest -- and I mean no offense -- the maps that you're using, are, well...  _(hesitation; then, decisive:)_ Old. Outdated, *very* much so. I can --

#### ALESTES

Oh, we've *really* been snooping, haven't we? 

#### BAKER

_(curious)_ How much do they sell for? Your maps? 

#### SIVA

Ah. Well -- I haven't... officially... ever *sold* one, but --

#### ALESTES

_(heavy sarcasm)_ Oh, in that case, come aboard! 

#### BAKER

You must have been hired, though, right? That uniform... 

#### SIVA

_(delighted)_ Yes, yes! Youngest promotion, sir, from "boy" to _(grandly)_ "assistant to the cartographer"!

#### ALESTES

_(deader than the deadest pan)_ Oooh, "assistant to the cartographer." 

#### SIVA

But I'm good, I promise -- I can show you! _(unwrapping something)_ Here! 

#### ALESTES

We are not hiring! 

#### BAKER

Aw, the kid's in distress, Alestes. The least we can do is look. 

#### ALESTES

How old are you, Siva? 

#### SIVA

Er -- twenty-three, Miss.

#### ALESTES

_(darkly)_ "Captain." 

#### SIVA

Oh, no no no, I'm *definitely* not a captain, Miss --

#### ALESTES

*I'm* the captain. 

#### SIVA

_(getting it)_ Oh. 

#### ALESTES

See? He's 23. Not a child. 

#### SIVA

I don't mind, they called me "boy" in --

#### ALESTES

And, Baker, a 23-year-old stowaway wearing a British officer's uniform. 

#### SIVA

I can explain.

#### ALESTES

I don't want you to! I want you, *and* your drama, off *my* ship, before *we* become implicated. 

#### SIVA

But... I don't have anywhere else to go. 

#### ALESTES

Frankly, Siva, I don't give a damn. 

#### SIVA

_(deflates)_ Oh. Right... I see.

##### [SIVA TAKES A FEW SAD FOOTSTEPS] 

#### BAKER

*Alestes.* When I found you on that beach --

#### ALESTES

*No,* Baker.

#### BAKER

You were barely alive! A child, so alone.

#### ALESTES

_(simultaneously, parodying)_ "A child, so alone!"

#### BAKER

If I hadn't pulled you --

#### ALESTES

-- out of that hurricane, yes, Baker! I know! I am not that child anymore. I haven't been for over a decade.

#### BAKER

The kid needs help. 

#### ALESTES

The "kid" is going to drag us into a headache I cannot even begin to fathom. This is *my* ship; *I'm* the captain; my decisions are final. Siva.

#### SIVA

_(perking up)_ Yes? 

#### ALESTES

*Go away.* 

#### SIVA

_(deflates)_ Oh. ...I understand. _(small, sad laugh)_ Thank you for your consideration.

##### [FOOTSTEPS AS SIVA LEAVES VIA THE LADDER] 

#### ALESTES

_(to Baker)_ *What?*

#### BAKER

Sometimes... 

#### ALESTES

You wish you'd left me to drown? 

#### BAKER

_(fiercely)_ No, Alestes. Never. I just wish -- 

#### ALESTES

_(interrupting)_ The hold's empty. I'll see what I can scrounge at the market. Buy some tat, hike the price, hawk it to the first fool I come across. Do that, what... a dozen more times, our coffers will be back to bursting and we can hire enough damned crew to get us across the Atlantic. Be ready to accept provisions.

#### BAKER

Of course. 

#### ALESTES

And next time I catch a rat, Baker, it's dead. No more lectures, no more strays. 

#### BAKER

_(sighing)_ Aye, Captain.

##### [MUSIC WITH RHYTHMIC DRUMBEATS AS OUR SCENE SLOWLY FADES AWAY AND IS REPLACED WITH:]

##### [THE HUBBUB OF A PORT. FOOTSTEPS. ALESTES HEFTS HER COIN PURSE.] 

#### ALESTES

_(to herself)_ Just got to find the right --

#### SIVA

_(cheerful)_ I can help you search! 

#### ALESTES

MOTHER OF --

#### SIVA

Find the right what? Fish-seller? British encampment? Mountain range? _(gasps)_ Tea plantation?! 

#### ALESTES

I thought I told you to piss off. 

#### SIVA

Off your ship! But you need a guide, don't you? This is Kalitivu, which isn't your ship, and I'm a cartographer, which means I know every nook and cranny of every mountain, and I know fun facts, too, like -- did you know, Ancient Greek geographers called our neighbour island of Ceylon "Taprobana," based on --

#### ALESTES

Not interested. 

#### SIVA

_(stammering)_ No -- uh -- but -- uhm -- what about -- well, well, we don't have much a tourist might be interested in, *but* --

#### ALESTES

You really need to work on your pitch. 

#### SIVA

_(desperate)_ I-I-I could show you the Governor's house! 

#### ALESTES

*Goodbye.* 

#### SIVA

It's *huge.* And -- and, uhm -- there was a raid! Which -- that's -- you like weapons, right? Is that exciting? And it's always empty, so it would be no trouble to --

##### [ALESTES UNSHEATHES THE TOP OF HER SWORD.] 

#### ALESTES

_(matter-of-fact)_ Get in my way again and I'll gut you, rat. 

#### SIVA

_(terrified)_ Right! Yes. Of course.

##### [CRUNCHY FOOTSTEPS AS ALESTES WALKS AWAY] 

#### SIVA

_(strained)_ Have a beautiful day!

##### [SIVA'S FOOTSTEPS RESOUND. IT BECOMES FORESTED AS HE WALKS.] 

_(self-pep talk)_ All right, Siva, old chap, this is fine. More than fine. It's an island! There'll be more ships. There are always more ships. Just one more day, and there'll be another ship, captained by a captain with less swords and... more... *smiles!* Yes. Good plan, Siva. _(affecting slightly different voice, conversing with himself)_ Thank you, Siva. Just gotta avoid the town, and avoid all the soldiers.

##### [FOLIAGE CRUNCHES AND RUSTLES, INSECTS BUZZ AND BIRDS CHATTER, AS THE SOUND OF THE PORT FADES]

Walk into the forest. You like sleeping out in the forest. It's like being in the camp again! Just with less... food. And fire.

##### [INSECT SOUNDS BECOME MORE PROMINENT]

But Siva! This whole island is full of food! _(replying)_ You're right, Siva, just because you were a cartographer and not a botanist doesn't mean you can't pick out something edible! Avoid red!

_(doubt)_ Ah... but strawberries are red. Hm. Green is... good for you, right?

##### [SIVA PULLS A LEAF OFF OF A TREE AND EATS IT]

##### [HE IMMEDIATELY SPITS IT OUT] 

Hm. This is fine! Everything's going to be fine. I don't need to eat! Once I'm on a ship, they'll give me rations!

##### [THE DISTANT VOICES OF PEOPLE ARE BECOMING CLEARER: IDLE, LOUD CONVERSATION]

And if there isn't a ship in the morning, then... Then... One more night in the rainforest, the scary men won't catch me and I'll be on the first ship to London --

##### [SIVA HALTS SUDDENLY]

##### [THIS IS A CLEARING, WITH A CAMPFIRE AND SCARY MEN]

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

_(startled)_ Wha -- what are you doing here? 

#### SIVA

Ah. _(terrified)_ Hello, gentlemen.

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [LOUD HUBBUB OF A MARKET IN THE PORT] 

#### ALESTES

No, no, no, too expensive! I wouldn't pay that in London, let alone Kalitivu! 

#### MARKET SELLER

This is best price in Kalitivu, you won't get cheaper anywhere else on the island. 

#### ALESTES

Look at this! Chipped glaze, and in a style three decades out of fashion!

#### MARKET SELLER

Full price, no discounts for "merchants" like you. 

#### ALESTES

I'm not paying full price for goods like this! 

#### MARKET SELLER

_(snorts)_ Go on then, walk away. 

#### ALESTES

Two paisa. 

#### MARKET SELLER

Two rupee. 

#### ALESTES

A quarter anna. 

#### MARKET SELLER

_(amused at Alestes's resistance)_ Two rupee.

#### ALESTES

*One* anna. Final offer. 

#### MARKET SELLER

Keep walking, girl. 

#### ALESTES

*"Captain."* 

#### MARKET SELLER

Hah! What ship would make you Captain?

##### [A NOW-FAMILIAR SOUND: ALESTES STARTS TO DRAW HER SWORD]

##### [DISTANTLY, A MUSKET SHOT] 

#### ALESTES

What the --

#### MARKET SELLER

_(smug)_ They caught another one. 

#### ALESTES

Another -- what? 

#### MARKET SELLER

Wannabe revolutionary, shot for trying to cheat the crown and its children. 

#### ALESTES

"Children"? Huh.

##### [SWORD IS SHEATHED]

You really think some royal across the sea cares about *you,* some piss-poor porcelain merchant, all the way out here? 

#### MARKET SELLER

You -- _(audibly holds themself back)_ Go on, watch in the square. See what folk less lenient than me do with shameless brats like you.

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC, OMINOUS AND LOW]

##### [A CROWD MILLS EXCITEDLY AROUND A PLATFORM IN THE SQUARE. ALESTES PUSHES HERSELF THROUGH ONLOOKERS.] 

#### ALESTES

_(faint among shouts of crowd)_ Move. Get out of my way.

##### [A VOICE RINGS OUT ABOVE THE CROWD:]

#### LIEUTENANT GEORGE

Listen.

Watch.

Do not look away.

_(pronounced with a studied correctness)_ Sivapathasundaram. Charged with... desertion.

##### [THE CROWD BOOS AND JEERS]

#### ALESTES

Oh. Good.

##### [SIVA IS DRAGGED, STRUGGLING, THROUGH THE CROWD]

#### SIVA

I swear, I didn't -- I-I wasn't -- I just needed --

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

_(deadpan)_ Keep mewling, kid, see where that gets you. 

#### GEORGE

For this crime he will face a fair trial. Lenience will mean corporal punishment, here, in public. Justice will be to put him to the firing line.

##### [SIVA STRUGGLES IN THEIR GRIP] 

#### SIVA

*Please!* Ask Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw, he'll vouch for me --

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

Shut your trap while Lieutenant George is addressing you! 

#### SIVA

_(shouting)_ Or -- or Lance Corporal Davids, or Private Pearson... or -- Governor Peters! 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

_(scoffing)_ Peters couldn't save his own arse, you think he'd come get yours? 

#### GEORGE

Silence, the lot of you. 

#### SIVA

But... but they... 

#### GEORGE

Finally, conspiracy with the group calling themselves the "Fly Fishers."

##### [THE CROWD BOOS A LITTLE LOUDER AT THIS]

What say you to this accusation, *boy?* 

#### SIVA

This is all a mistake! I wasn't running away, not forever! Nani -- my Nani, my grandmother -- she -- in the raid -- and I -- I just needed some time to -- _(yanking in breaths painfully)_ a-and then they said I was deserting, which I wasn't!

#### GEORGE

Casualties are natural in the course of exterminating those who see fit to undermine our Empire. Do you disagree, boy? 

#### SIVA

I-I...

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

Hang him for treason!

#### GEORGE

Listen.

Watch.

Do not look away.

See what comes from disobeying. Watch as justice prevails. Feel our lenience when it is given fairly!

#### SIVA

No, please! 

#### ALESTES

_(to herself)_ Always a shame when they're taken so young.

_(takes a bracing breath)_ Oh well. Was nice knowing you, you strange little tadpole. May you be less pathetic in your next life. 

#### SIVA

_(recognition)_ _(a gasp)_ Miss... Alestes? 

#### ALESTES

*Damn* it. 

#### SIVA

_(disbelievingly)_ You came to save me?! Miss Alestes, I -- How can I ever repay you?

#### ALESTES

You've got the wrong person, kid!

#### SIVA

I knew from the second I first saw you, I thought, "wow, she's so cool and brave and talented, and her sword is so shiny and pointy and --" 

#### GEORGE

ENOUGH OF THIS FARCE. I will have QUIET, do you understand me?

##### [SIVA WHIMPERS]

##### [TENSE MUSIC FADES IN] 

Sivapathasundaram. Charged with desertion, treason, conspiracy and contempt. He will be punished as all others calling themselves rebels were: death.

##### [SIVA WHIMPERS AGAIN]

#### ALESTES

_(recalling, against her will)_ "A child, so alone..."

_(sighs)_ What Baker doesn't know can't hurt him.

...But he'll be able to tell, he always can. 

Uuuughhhhhhhh...

##### [LONG INTERNAL DEBATE]

##### [DEBATE IS WON BY THE "BAKER" SIDE, TO ALESTES'S CLEAR ANNOYANCE]

All right, fine.

##### [ALESTES STEPS INTO THE SQUARE] 

_(bright, only a hint of contempt)_ I have a question for you, boys. 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

_(bored)_ Step aside. 

#### ALESTES

It's a very serious question. 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

Piss off, unless you want trouble too! 

#### ALESTES

You're not even the least bit curious about what I have to ask? 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

Last warning.

#### ALESTES

Or what, you'll shoot me?

##### [BANG! A FLOCK OF SEA BIRDS STARTLE, THE CROWD SHOUTS, BUT THE SHOT GOES WIDE.]

You won't get very far in life if your aim's as bad as *that.*

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

That was a warning shot! 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

And your last! 

#### ALESTES

Mmmhm.

##### [HER FOOTSTEPS DO NOT STOP]

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

Halt! Don't you come any closer! 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

Should I raise the alarm, sir? 

#### GEORGE

_(amused, slow)_ It's a coloured woman and a boy, private. _(laughingly)_ Do you fear we need assistance? 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

_(uncertain)_ Uh... no, sir?

#### GEORGE

You have a question, girl? 

#### ALESTES

_(matter-of-fact)_ When I kill you... would you rather the sword, or the pistol?

##### [BEAT]

##### [GEORGE BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER] 

#### GEORGE

Mighty words, girl --

##### [ALESTES QUICK-DRAWS A GUN FROM A HOLSTER AND FIRES]

##### [GEORGE CRIES OUT IN PAIN]

##### [THE CROWD GOES FRANTIC WITH PANIC] 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

Lieutenant George! 

#### ALESTES

_(to Siva)_ Get to the *Netaoansom,* I'll hold them off! 

#### SIVA

To the *what?* 

#### ALESTES

The *ship!*

#### SIVA

Ah. That makes sense in context --

#### ALESTES 

RUN!

##### [THEY RUN] 

##### [MORE TENSE MUSIC]

#### GEORGE

You, don't let them escape. You, raise the alarm!

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 3

But sir, you're bleeding --?

#### GEORGE 

GO!

#### SOLDIERS 2&3

Yes, sir!

##### [SOLDIER 3 RUNS OFF, WHISTLING FOR BACKUP]

##### [AN ALARM BELL STARTS RINGING AS ALESTES INTERCEPTS SOLDIER 2] 

#### ALESTES

What will it be, friend, the blade or the bullet? 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

Insolent woman --

#### ALESTES

"Insolent"! That word's a bit above your pay grade, no? 

#### BRITISH SOLDIER 2

You --

#### GEORGE

She's playing games with you! Shoot her!

##### [BRITISH SOLDIER 2 SHOOTS] 

#### ALESTES

_(mock-concerned)_ Oh, sweetheart, was that your best effort?

##### [ALESTES DRAWS HER SWORD AND CUTS THE SOLDIER DOWN WITH A CRY. HE FALLS TO THE GROUND]

##### [ALESTES APPROACHES GEORGE, GETS IN CLOSE]

#### ALESTES

Lieutenant George. 

#### GEORGE

You will pay for this, girl.

#### ALESTES

I doubt that very much.

##### [BANG.]

##### [GEORGE YELPS.]

##### [BEAT.]

#### GEORGE

You... missed. 

#### ALESTES

"Feel our lenience when it is given fairly," *pig.*

##### [THE ALARM RINGS LOUD AND CLEAR]

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [ALESTES CATCHES UP TO SIVA. IN THE DISTANCE, A GROUP OF SOLDIERS ARE ARMING UP. THE BRITISH ALARM BELL CONTINUES TO SOUND.] 

#### ALESTES

_(panting)_ Can you run faster?! 

#### SIVA

_(panting)_ No, Miss -- ah -- Captain! 

#### ALESTES

Christ -- what *can* you do?! 

#### SIVA

I'm a cartographer, Mi -- Captain!

##### [A MUSKET SHOT WHISTLES THROUGH THE AIR]

#### ALESTES

Zigzag as you run! Did they teach you anything in the army?

##### [SEVERAL MUSKET SHOTS PUNCTUATE THEIR CONVERSATION]

#### SIVA

No, Captain!

#### ALESTES

Get *down!*

##### [A SHOT WHISTLES OVER THEIR HEADS, FAR TOO CLOSE]

##### [THEY CATCH THEIR BREATH]

#### SIVA

Thank you, Captain, for saving me!

#### ALESTES

This is not the time. 

#### SIVA

You didn't have to, and --

#### ALESTES

I didn't do it for you.

#### SIVA

_(genuine question)_ Who did you do it for?

#### ALESTES

_(ignoring him)_ They're approaching the bend in the road. We'll have a few seconds to get across the dock to the ship --

#### SIVA

Well, thank you, regardless! Even if it wasn't for me, specifically, you still saved my life!

#### ALESTES

I should have left you there. 

#### SIVA

But you didn't!

##### [A NEW SOUND: SAILS BLOW IN THE WIND]

_(immediate panic)_ Captain, your ship, it's leaving! 

#### ALESTES

Baker must have seen the commotion. Good man, catching the wind for us! Come on, it'll be a running jump.

##### [ALESTES PULLS SIVA INTO A RUN ACROSS THE DOCKS] 

#### SIVA

*What?* No, I couldn't possibly --

##### [THE SOUND OF THE WAVES GROW LOUDER] 

#### ALESTES

Get some speed in you!

##### [SIVA AND ALESTES DASH DOWN THE BOARDWALK]

#### ALESTES

Jump, Siva, go!

#### SIVA

_(panting)_ AaaaaaAAAAAAA*AAAAAA* --

##### [SIVA JUMPS AND IS CAUGHT IN BAKER'S WAITING ARMS] 

#### BAKER

I've got you, climb up! There we are!

##### [ALESTES JUMPS AND CATCHES HERSELF IN THE ROPES OF THE SHIP] 

#### ALESTES

Baker, unfurl the jib!

#### BAKER

Aye, Captain! 

#### ALESTES

Siva, take the glass, tell me if they've got cannons readied --

#### SIVA

Yes, Captain! 

#### ALESTES

Let's get outta here!

##### [WHOOSH -- THE JIB SAIL FILLS WITH WIND -- AND THE *NETAOANSOM* IS OFF.]

#### ALESTES & BAKER

_(triumphant)_ *Woohoo!*

##### [SIVA BEGINS TO CRY IN RELIEF]

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [A WAVE CRASHES]

##### [WE'RE ASAIL: THE LAPPING OF WAVES, THE HOWLING OF THE WIND, AND THE SEA BIRDS ARE MUFFLED. THE SHIP CREAKS.]

#### BAKER

We were lucky they had no ships at the ready. Too busy re-provisioning. 

#### ALESTES

Kau sai -- provisions!

#### BAKER

_(lower)_ We're supposed to be keeping a low profile, Alestes. Especially this close to *his* territory. 

#### ALESTES

Good thing I didn't pay that hack market seller. 

#### BAKER

Who knows where his area of control extends now? 

#### ALESTES

Another blasted week of hardtack.

##### [ALESTES SITS ON HER BED HEAVILY AND GROANS -- IN PAIN]

#### BAKER

_(sudden worry)_ Were you injured? 

#### ALESTES

_(gritted teeth)_ I'm fine. 

#### BAKER

Here, let me check your --

#### ALESTES

Stop buzzing, old man, I'm *fine.* 

#### BAKER

Are you sure? 

#### ALESTES

I need a meal, Baker. A proper one. That's all. 

#### BAKER

_(letting it lie for now)_ ...Siva, he said he knows the area. He might know some islands out of Gammon's control. 

#### ALESTES

Good-for-nothing better pay his way *somehow.* 

#### BAKER

I'll make sure he's settled in. You rest up. 

#### ALESTES

Tell him not to touch anything. Any food he finds down there is mine. 

#### BAKER

_(fondly)_ Aye, Captain.

And... thank you. For helping him. 

#### ALESTES

_(yawning)_ I didn't do it for... whatever. 

#### BAKER

Night, Alestes.

##### [ALESTES MAKES A NONCOMMITTAL GRUNT]

##### [THE CABIN DOOR ROLLS CLOSED]

#### ALESTES

_(softer, to herself)_ Goodnight, Baker.
