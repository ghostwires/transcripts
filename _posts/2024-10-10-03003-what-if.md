Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus Protocol.

What If Episode 1 -- What If They Listened to Colin? 

##### [Music]

---

<!-- 1. O.I.A.R. MAIN OFFICE -- AFTERNOON, CLEAR (ALICE'S PHONE) ALICE is working on her computer. It's a top-of-the-line model: fast, sleek and slick. By contrast ALICE is plodding through her work. ALICE sighs, moans and stretches luxuriously. LENA almost immediately starts to tap on her glass.  -->

#### ALICE

_(muttering)_ Yeah, yeah...

ALICE returns to work. It's agonizingly monotonous.

Eventually, COLIN enters. 

#### COLIN

Hey Alice, sorry to interrupt --

#### ALICE

_(manic)_ Oh thank god -- Colin! Colin, my main man, the techlord himself, how are you? It's great to see you! 

#### COLIN

_(dubious)_ Uh-huh.

#### ALICE

_(standing)_ We should go catch up -- grab a coffee in the breakroom, share a few laughs, catch each other up on --

LENA taps on her glass again. ALICE takes a theatrically deep and steadying breath and sits again, her manic energy evaporating. 

#### ALICE

...literally anything than sitting alone at my desk forever. 

#### COLIN

_(chuckling)_ Problems? 

#### ALICE

Everything is working just like you said it would. 

#### COLIN

Told you. And all it took was ripping the entire system out and rebuilding it from the ground up. No more mad German algorithms, just nice straightforward webcrawlers. 

#### ALICE

Uh-huh. I want you to change it back. 

#### COLIN

Alice --

#### ALICE

Just hear me out, all right? It's not like you've got anything better to do. 

#### COLIN

I mean...

#### ALICE

And that's exactly the problem. When you said you could "fix everything," I kinda thought you meant you would make it better for *everyone.* 

#### COLIN

_(incredulous)_ It is better --

#### ALICE

Is it though? Or am I sitting here alone, bored out of my goddamned skull? 

#### COLIN

Alice, you were bored before, besides which this place was a madhouse. Nothing worked, no one could get anything done --

#### ALICE

_(wistful)_ It was wonderful... 

#### COLIN

It was my own personal hell, is what it was. And now look around. Everything works, it takes you half as long to get through your case load --

#### ALICE

-- so Lena gives me twice as much --

#### COLIN

And now we're working days. We get weekends now, bank holidays, we get to see the sun!

#### ALICE

I hate the sun. 

#### COLIN

No you don't. 

#### ALICE

And I miss Freddy and Chester and Norris and...

##### [Colin sighs.] 

#### COLIN

You said you liked the new system. 

#### ALICE

And I did. Until it got everyone fired.

##### [Beat.]

How exactly did you think they were going to pay for the overhaul with all those extra bells and whistles you said they needed? 

#### COLIN

I dunno, Lena said she'd take care of it... 

#### ALICE

Pro tip, Colin, mate, when someone says they're going to "take care of it" you might want to check if they mean it in a pinstripe suit, concrete galoshes kind of way before going ahead with it.

#### COLIN

...

You literally cheered when Gwen left.

#### ALICE

That was different. That was funny.

##### [She sighs deeply.]

But what the hell do I do now? I'm a cat without a mouse, no one to bullshit with, no one to talk to... I'm trapped down here alone, the last years of my youth leaking out through every tap of my desperately ergonomic keyboard.

##### [She taps mournfully at the keys]

##### [The computer gives a beautiful soothing chirrup of approval]

#### ALICE

Disgusting... 

#### COLIN

Not my fault you had the best KPIs. Anyway, I might have something here to cheer you up. 

#### ALICE

Oh yeah? 

#### COLIN

_(pulling out from his bag)_ New company phone. Lena said you've been having issues with your old one. 

#### ALICE

Yeah, it had this weird bug where it got thrown out of a window. 

#### COLIN

Well, she says she needs you "on call," so...

#### ALICE

Don't do this to me, Colin.

##### [He hands her the new phone.]

#### COLIN

It's got a really janky AI assistant... Maybe that'll fill the void?

#### ALICE

...

Well it's a start, I suppose...

##### [ALICE turns her phone off.]

<!-- 2. The Pub Int.- Afternoon, clear (SAM's Phone) The Pub is crowded and louder than is comfortable. SAM pushes his way through to get to Gwen.  -->

#### SAM

Watch your backs!

##### [He sits and hands Gwen her drink.]

#### SAM

They're out of sherry, so I got you a G and T. 

#### GWEN

Thank you, I guess. 

#### SAM

Next one's on you. It's funny, I used to wonder how this place could afford to stay open.

#### GWEN

It's almost like pubs make more money at six PM on a Tuesday than five AM on a Sunday. 

#### SAM

Right? You know, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I miss working nights. I'd forgotten how the Tube is during rush hour. 

#### GWEN

Traffic's the same. 

#### SAM

Makes sense.

They both drink. It's clear they have absolutely nothing to talk about. 

#### SAM

So... what have you been up to? 

#### GWEN

Went home to visit family. 

#### SAM

Sounds nice. 

#### GWEN

It wasn't. How about you? 

#### SAM

Er, no, I am staying as far away from mum and dad as I can until I've got better news. I've been applying for jobs, but for now it's beep-beep. 

#### GWEN

Beep-beep?

_(realizing)_ Ah.

#### SAM

Sainsbury's. And even that was a struggle. 

#### GWEN

Sounds... interesting. 

#### SAM

Does it? 

#### GWEN

Not really, no.

They both drink. It's amazing how silent they can be in such a noisy place. 

#### GWEN

Are you still investigating that university? 

#### SAM

Hm? Oh, the Magnus Institute? Ha, fat chance, this is the first time off I've had off in two weeks. No, it turns out creepy mysteries are a bourgeois luxury.

#### GWEN

Careful, you're starting to sound like Alice.

##### [They both hesitate.]

#### SAM

Have you heard anything from --

#### GWEN

_(icy)_ No. 

#### SAM

Gwen, it's not her fault...

##### [Another pause.]

#### SAM

So...

##### [Teddy noisily approaches them.] 

#### TEDDY

Coming through, coming through! 

#### SAM

_(aside)_ Oh thank Christ.

#### TEDDY

Heeeey, there you both are! And you got a table, nice! 

#### GWEN

I got here early. I had time to kill. 

#### TEDDY

_(sitting)_ I hear that! Well, let's see if we can do something about that.

#### SAM

Yeah, so -- don't get me wrong Teddy, I appreciate the invite, but like, what's this about? 

#### GWEN

I'm somewhat curious myself. 

#### TEDDY

Ah right, straight to it then. Ahem. I've got you both a job. 

#### GWEN

Excuse me?

#### TEDDY

Well, almost. Provisionally at least. Basically, the people I'm working for heard that there are more ex-O.I.A.R. staff looking for a gig, and they are just so happy with me they want to see if either of you are interested. Congrats, you've both been headhunted. 

#### SAM

Huh. Okay, so like -- what do they --

#### GWEN

Why? 

#### TEDDY

...Sorry? 

#### GWEN

The O.I.A.R. was hardly a dynamic work environment, and no offence, Sam, but the ink was still wet on your probation when they kicked you out. 

#### SAM

Okay, some offence, but whatever. 

#### GWEN

My point is, why on earth would they want to headhunt both of us? 

#### TEDDY

I mean there's a certain amount of overlap and you can say this for the O.I.A.R. -- for all its faults, it was "specialist." I suppose you could call it resource allocation.

#### GWEN

Hm. 

#### SAM

Not my first choice, but I could definitely be convinced. So like, do they want to meet or --

#### TEDDY

Yep. 

#### SAM

Okay cool, I should be able to get some time off booked next week if --

#### TEDDY

Now. 

#### SAM

What? 

#### TEDDY

I told you they were keen. That's why I asked you here in person. If you're interested, I can get you signed up right now. 

#### SAM

Uh, okay. I am available I guess...

##### [ALICE enters unobserved in the background.]

#### ALICE

_(distant)_ I'll try and grab us a table! 

#### GWEN

_(not noticing)_ No. 

#### SAM

No?

#### GWEN

_(preparing to leave)_ Oh, I think you should definitely take this opportunity, Sam, but I think I'm going to have to be a bit more... discerning this time round. No offence. 

#### SAM

Again, kind of offended, but whatever. 

#### TEDDY

If you're sure... 

#### GWEN

I very much am. Working for the O.I.A.R. was a... phase. _(hint of sadness)_ I've been talking with my father and well -- Anyway, if you'll both excuse me I have a car waiting --

#### ALICE

_(to crowd)_ Watch your backs, hot stuff coming through!

_(noticing the gang)_ Oh. Er... Hi. 

#### GWEN

_(icy)_ Ms Dyer. Surprised to see you here at this time. 

#### ALICE

Oh yeah, we're on days now so, y'know... 

#### GWEN

Of course you are. If you'll excuse me.

#### SAM

See you, Gwen. 

#### TEDDY

Yeah, bye!

GWEN exits as aloof as she can manage in a dense London drinking crowd. 

#### ALICE

Hey Sam, Teddy. 

#### TEDDY

Hey Alice! 

#### SAM

Hey.

##### [Beat.]

#### TEDDY

So yeah, tell you what then Sam, why don't I go call them and let them know you're coming and you can follow after you've had a chance to er... catch up? 

#### SAM

Sure. 

#### TEDDY

Catch you later, Alice, yeah? 

#### ALICE

Sure, look after yourself. 

#### TEDDY

Always do!

TEDDY exits through the dense crowd. 

#### ALICE

So... you haven't drowned.

#### SAM

What? 

#### ALICE

My new therapist tells me I need to think more positively. I notice you haven't been flayed by an industrial shredder either. 

#### SAM

_(smiling)_ Yeah no, I'm fine. You? 

#### ALICE

Same old, enforcing the evil will of a self-interested government one taxpayer-funded paycheck at a time. 

#### SAM

Cool.

Beat. Alice is clearly uncomfortable and works herself up to: 

#### ALICE

Listen, Sam --

#### SAM

You don't need to apologise. 

#### ALICE

No, really, I --

#### SAM

It's fine, honestly. You couldn't have known. 

#### ALICE

None of us did. I mean, Lena was literally interviewing another newbie the day before!

#### SAM

I get it. It just... sucked, y'know?

#### ALICE

I do.

...

It was good to see you again. Would've been nice if it had lasted. 

#### SAM

Yeah, well, unfortunately this is clearly a pretty bleak timeline.

##### [He drinks.] 

#### ALICE

You're forgetting about the one where Colin went mental and built an army of robots to torment us in his cyberpunk sex dungeon. 

#### SAM

Eh, at least it wasn't boring. Speaking of...

##### [COLIN enters.] 

#### COLIN

You got a table? Nice one! Oh hey, uh... 

#### SAM

_(coolly)_ Sam. 

#### COLIN

_(guiltily)_ Sam, right, yeah. How you doing? 

#### SAM

I was actually just leaving. I've got an interview.

#### COLIN

Oh great! 

#### SAM

Assuming it lasts longer than the last one... 

#### COLIN

_(guiltily)_ Hah... yeah... 

#### ALICE

_(joking)_ Let me know if they need anyone to turn up and make the corporate culture impossibly toxic. I'd be wanting six figures and use of the corporate jet of course. 

#### SAM

_(standing)_ Of course. Have a good one, guys. Say hi to Chester for me. 

#### ALICE

Hah, will do.

SAM exits taking the phone with him as COLIN sits. Growing distant: 

#### COLIN

I doubt he could've hacked it anyway. 

#### ALICE

I'll hack *you* in a minute...
