##### [SHOW THEME - INTRO]

#### BAKER

Rusty Quill Presents: *Trice Forgotten.*

Episode Two: Heavy Cargo. 

##### [THEME FINISHES]

##### [WE ARE IN NANI'S SMALL KITCHEN. BUBBLING, STEAMING, AND THE HISS OF OIL AS INGREDIENTS ARE ADDED TO A PAN]

##### [NANI AND SIVA'S VOICES ECHO; THIS IS A MEMORY] 

#### NANI

_(singing softly)_ Khoka ghumalo, para juralo; Khoka ghumalo, para juralo... 

##### [SIVA COMES BOLTING INTO THE KITCHEN, TRIUMPHANT]

##### [NANI BUSTLES ABOUT THE KITCHEN] 

#### SIVA

Nana, Nani! It happened! They promoted me! "Assistant Cartographer Siva!" Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw himself said I was the youngest boy they had ever promoted! And -- and I have a new uniform, *and* Private Pearson cleared out some old beer bottles from a corner of the mess, so I would have somewhere to work! And I have two boxes, one to sit on *and* one to draw my maps -- _(contented sigh)_ Ah! It's been a most wonderful day.

##### [SILENCE]

_(worried)_ Nani? You... do think it's wonderful?

#### NANI

_(arch)_ Mmm. Here you are in my kitchen! And not a greeting for your Nani, eh? 

#### SIVA

_(understanding)_ Nani! _(fondly)_ Vanakam Nani, ithu atputhamana vaasanai! [Translation: Hello Nani, it smells wonderful!]

##### [SIVA GIGGLES]

#### NANI

Flattery, is it? Perhaps you could manage to talk and roll these rotis at the same time, seeing as you're such a clever boy? 

#### SIVA

Yes, yes, look, here I go, rolling rotis. See? 

##### [HE PULLS THE BOWL OF DOUGH AND ROLLING STONE TOWARDS HIM AND STARTS ROLLING]

##### [A FEW MOMENTS OF QUIET, THEN:] 

#### SIVA

_(giving in)_ But do you not think it is exciting?! 

#### NANI

_(looking at the rotis)_ They're too thick, and they won't bake properly. Put some muscle into it. 

#### SIVA

Nani! 

##### [BEAT]

#### NANI

Anbe, nee santhosamaga yirupathal ennakum santhosam. [Translation: Dear, I'm happy because you're happy.] _(she lets out a breath)_ I always knew you were a bright one. 

#### SIVA

This could be the start of something great, Nani. I'm already ahead with my Latin and Greek, and if I work hard -- Private Pearson says I could go anywhere in the Empire with what they're teaching me. 

#### NANI

And where will you go, when you have had enough of me? 

#### SIVA

Nani, I'll never leave you. _(beat)_ But -- perhaps Cambridge. 

#### NANI

Cambridge? Ah. Go and bring the mallung.

##### [SIVA FETCHES THE POT]

And what will you do there? 

#### SIVA

I'll read history, of course. The progress of the world, the great men who shaped it -- laid out like a book for me to understand! And then I'll work at the Queen's Museum. 

#### NANI

The Queen's Museum! With all the treasures of their history, and they still feel the need to come here and take ours?

#### SIVA

_(thinking she doesn't believe in him)_ I *can* do it, Nani. The British in the camp say that I am improving every day. 

##### [AA NOISE BEGINS SOFTLY IN THE BACKGROUND, A NOISE THAT SHOULDN'T BE THERE: THE CREAKING OF A SHIP'S ROPES AND THE WARPING OF WOOD.] 

#### NANI

It's not you I'm worried about, paetiya.

_(carefully)_ _(she sounds further away)_ I just want you to remember... _(echoing)_ Your future is not written just yet. 

##### [THE PRESENT. QUIET MOVEMENT OF WATER AGAINST THE HULL, THE CRY OF BIRDS, AND NOT A HINT OF BREEZE. THE KIND OF HEAT HUM THAT SIGNIFIES STILLNESS, STULTIFICATION.]

##### [BAKER HUMS SOFTLY TO HIMSELF AS HE WORKS. SIVA APPROACHES UNCERTAINLY.] 

#### SIVA

_(clears throat)_ Good morning. 

#### BAKER

Trouble sleeping? 

#### SIVA

_(forced cheer)_ I-I would like to be helpful, please. 

#### BAKER

Helpful? 

#### SIVA

You are... unfamiliar with the concept? 

#### BAKER

_(wry)_ You could say that. What did you have in mind? 

#### SIVA

Perhaps I could help with these -- _(trying to impress)_ l-lines. 

#### BAKER

Ropes. 

#### SIVA

Ropes, that you're folding --

#### BAKER

Stowing. 

#### SIVA

_(a flicker of frustration)_ Stowing! 

#### BAKER

_(sighs; throws him a bone)_ When you prepare a rope for a task, it becomes a line. These are unemployed, so they're just ropes.

##### [A WAVE SWELLS]

_(gentle)_ Why don't you relax? There'll be plenty to do once Alestes is up. 

#### SIVA

Then... perhaps I could prepare breakfast for when she awakes? 

#### BAKER

If you can make anything out of stale hardtack and dust, I reckon even the Captain will crack a smile.

#### SIVA

Stale hardtack...?

#### BAKER

Stores are still empty. In her haste to bring you aboard, the Captain didn't finish her weekly shopping.

#### SIVA

_(a little alarmed)_ Then we should make for a port posthaste, should we not? 

#### BAKER

_(light tease)_ Why didn't I think of that!

We're becalmed, lad. _(explaining)_ No wind, we're stuck. I hate to say it but if something doesn't turn up soon, we could be in trouble.

#### SIVA

Something... like that? 

##### [BAKER PUTS DOWN HIS ROPE AND SQUINTS AT WHERE SIVA IS POINTING.]

##### [THEN BAKER STARTS TO LAUGH, ASTONISHED.]

#### BAKER

I don't believe it. 

#### SIVA

It *is,* isn't it? 

#### BAKER

A boat --

#### SIVA

-- absolutely *loaded* with food! 

##### [BAKER CLAPS SIVA ON THE BACK SEVERAL TIMES]

#### BAKER

You got any more tricks like that up your sleeve? Can't summon me a pint, could you? 

#### SIVA

Jackfruit, kangkong, guava -- _(his voice climbs higher)_ and those are the ripest mangoes I've ever seen! _(calling out)_ AHOY THERE, TRAVELLER! COME ABOARD, WEARY --

#### BAKER

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? 

#### SIVA

They have food! I thought we needed --

#### BAKER

You don't invite someone on board without the Captain's say-so! W-what if they're dangerous? What if they're carrying sickness?

#### SIVA

_(alarmed)_ Do you think they have sickness?! 

#### BAKER

_(sighs)_ That's not the -- it's protocol to ask --

Never mind. Too late now. 

##### [BUMP AS THE BOAT GENTLY HITS THE SIDE OF THE *NETA.*]

#### SIVA

_(gasping, loud whisper)_ What if they're a pirate? 

#### BAKER

_(amused)_ With mangoes?

_(calling)_ Make yourself known, stranger!

##### [CREAKING AS SOMEONE VERY TALL AND VERY MUSCULAR CLIMBS THE LADDER ONTO THE DECK]

##### [THE PERSON LANDS WITH A THUMP] 

#### SIVA

_(awed)_ Gosh. They could lift me like a sack of flour! 

#### NOOR

Well met, friends. 

#### BAKER

Forgive my young crewmate's... enthusiasm in hailing you aboard -- he's new to the waters. _(introduction)_ Baker. 

#### NOOR

Noor. 

#### BAKER

That's a handsome haul you've got there, Noor. 

#### NOOR

A productive day's work, alhamdulillah. 

#### BAKER

Mm. I don't suppose we could interest you in --

#### SIVA

_(finding his voice)_ Siva! 

##### [BEAT]

#### NOOR

_(confused)_ Interest me in... Siva? 

#### SIVA

No, I'm -- I'm Siva. Sivapathasundaram. And, and this is Baker -- well, you, you know that, and this is the _(carefully, slowly)_ Net-ah-wan-sun, that is the, the ship, the ship that we're standing on, and what you *don't* see is Captain Alestes. She's -- she's doing important, ah, Captain things down-downstairs right now and -- and you're Noor, which, um, obviously, you know, and -- and we'd like some food please.

##### [BEAT]

##### [NOOR BURSTS OUT LAUGHING -- A STRANGELY MAGICAL SOUND, PURE ENJOYMENT, AND IT RELAXES EVERYONE ON DECK]

#### NOOR

Nice to meet you, Siva of the *Netaoansom.* As for the food --

#### BAKER

I think what the lad means to ask is if we can make a trade -- though we've very little to barter with. 

#### NOOR

_(confused)_ Your stores are empty? 

#### BAKER

_(assenting sigh)_ As an Englishman's heart. 

#### NOOR

But I don't understand. 

#### BAKER

What?

#### NOOR

This is one of the most fertile island chains on the Indian coast. Y-you can weigh anchor on any spit of land within a few miles and find sustenance. 

#### SIVA

You... _(even more awed)_ you mean you found all of this?! 

#### NOOR

Not all of it, but -- enough to barter for that which I could not forage, yes.

##### [BEAT]

#### SIVA

Could you show me? 

#### BAKER

Siva... 

#### SIVA

_(to Noor)_ Please? 

#### BAKER

_(quiet)_ I'm not sure it's such a good idea for you to leave the ship, and we can't impose --

#### NOOR

_(to Baker)_ No imposition. There's a cay a few miles to the west. I could have him back by high sun.

#### SIVA

Please, Baker. We've got nothing to trade, and I promise I'll work hard to earn my share of supper! 

#### BAKER

_(sigh)_ Back by midday then. You'll know where to find us. _(wry)_ Not like we're going anywhere.

##### [THE DRUMBEATS OF TRANSITIONAL MUSIC FADE IN, THEN OUT]

##### [THE BEACH OF A SMALL CAY IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. THE RUSH OF OCEAN WAVES. LUSH, ENTICING CHITTERING AND RUSTLING FROM THE SURROUNDING SRI LANKAN FOREST -- BIRDS CALL, INSECTS HUM]

##### [NOOR AND SIVA HAVE FINISHED THEIR FORAGING EXPEDITION AND ARE LOADING THE ROWING BOAT]

#### SIVA

_(singing "The British Grenadier" joyfully)_ Some talk of Alexander and some of Hercules! Of Hector and Lysander and such great names as these! But of all the world's brave heroes, there's none that can compare! With a tow, row, row, row, row, row, to Siva a-a-a-nd Noooooor!

##### [NOOR LAUGHS THAT LONG, MAGICAL LAUGH] 

#### SIVA

I think that's the last of the haul. All safely packed -- sorry, *stowed* away. I can't wait to show Baker! You know, he says people used to come from miles around to taste his cooking? Of course, I'm no slouch in the kitchen myself, I assist my Nani *all* the time -- ah, oh, uh,

##### [SIVA AUDIBLY PUSHES HIMSELF OUT OF A MEMORY]

"Assisted."

-- I mean, I called her my Nani but of course, she wasn't actually my blood, but I do think of her as my blood, or... I-I did think of her as...

Anyway! My actual parents were Tamil and not Bengali like my Nani, so she learned Tamil recipes for me, and I learned Bengali ones from her! Do you have a family?

##### [NOOR MAKES THE BRIEFEST OF UNCOMFORTABLE NOISES BUT IT HARDLY MATTERS BECAUSE SIVA PLOUGHS ON.] 

And Captain Alestes! I can't imagine she won't be pleased -- not that I've yet to see her pleased -- but she must be capable of it! She is a human being, after all! I mean, I think she is --

#### NOOR

A good meal softens even the hardest of hearts. 

#### SIVA

*Very* wise! Very wise indeed! Do you cook? 

#### NOOR

I've not much skill for it. But then, I never had much call -- for me, little surmounts the pleasure of _(pleased)_ crunching fresh, raw radishes. 

#### SIVA

_(shocked)_ Oh no. No, no, no, that won't do at all -- you must let me make you a curry to thank you. _(gasps to himself)_ Chicken with cashews, perhaps -- or white fish stewed tenderly with tamarind -- some mutton rolls on the side...

#### NOOR

_(gentle)_ Or, perhaps there is no need to cook meat at all.

##### [BEAT]

#### SIVA

Oh. I-I-I-I'm *so* sorry, I didn't realise -- are you a monk? 

#### NOOR

_(snorts, amused)_ Not to my knowledge. 

#### SIVA

No, it's just that mostly when people don't eat meat it's because they're very... um, extremely...  pious. Is it... prohibited for you? 

#### NOOR

No. I just... prefer not to. 

#### SIVA

Never at all? Not even good old _(tough voice)_ "meat and two veg," _(normal voice)_ as Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw says -- though I confess I'm never quite sure what the meat in question is supposed to be, it's always so tough and grey --

#### NOOR

One day I simply looked at my plate and thought, "not for me." 

#### SIVA

_(fascinated)_ I see.

_(brightening, claps)_ Egg rice and hoppers, then! 

#### NOOR

Not eggs either, I'm afraid. 

#### SIVA

_(astounded)_ Not *eggs?* 

#### NOOR

I do not wish to take *anything* from an animal it will not give me willingly. So no -- not eggs, or milk. 

#### SIVA

But the Bible says that the promised land was flowing with milk and honey! Surely if God wants us to, then --

#### NOOR

Not my Bible. Nor my God. 

#### SIVA

_(considering)_ Ohh.

And -- do all your people eat this way? 

#### NOOR

No. _(throwing him a bone)_ I come from a fishing village -- most make a living from their catches. 

##### [IN THE WIND, A BAMBOO PIPE. BARELY NOTICEABLE.]

#### SIVA

Is that why you left? So you wouldn't have to fish? I imagine it's a bloody business, all those guts and gills. What did your family think when you told them you were leaving? 

#### NOOR

_(uncomfortable)_ I -- they --

#### SIVA

And how did you come to be so far out on the ocean alone? E-even with your, your -- impressive physique, the stamina to row that far must be --

#### NOOR

I don't really like to talk about --

##### [THE BAMBOO PIPE PLAYS ON, HIGH, A LITTLE HAUNTING]

#### SIVA

And those bracelets you're wearing, such beauty! What is their meaning? They must be precious objects indeed for you to bring them with you -- who gave them --? 

#### NOOR

Lemongrass! 

##### [BEAT]

#### SIVA

I'm sorry? 

#### NOOR

Over there, a particularly fine growth of lemongrass. I-I'll just go and --

#### SIVA

I can come with you --! 

#### NOOR

No! _(pause)_ No need. I-I can do it myself. 

#### SIVA

_(beginning to realise his mistake)_ O-oh. I really didn't mean to, to pry -- I was just curious about your --

#### NOOR

_(abrupt, loud)_ They're *just things!* No deeper meaning than that. 

#### SIVA

Are you sure? Because I *really* didn't meant to... 

##### [NOOR CRUNCHES HURRIEDLY OFF ACROSS THE SAND]

...upset you.

##### [SIVA SIGHS]

Well done, Siva, you old charmer, you. "Welcome to the *Netaoansom!* Here's the local blithering idiot to make you feel at home."

##### [AN ARCH, ALMOST INDOLENT VOICE COMES FLOATING OUT OF SEEMINGLY NOWHERE.]

#### ANH

I don't know. I think you're rather sweet.

##### [SIVA GASPS]

_(then, business-like)_ Still going to knock you out with this oar, though. 

#### SIVA

Excuse me --? 

##### [CLONK!]

##### [AN URK! FROM SIVA] 

#### ANH

_(calling)_ Bo'sun! Get him aboard. 

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC: HIGH STRINGS]

##### [AND WE'RE BACK TO THE DECK OF THE *NETA.* SOUNDS AS BEFORE: WATER AGAINST THE HULL, HEAT HUM. THE GULLS SOUND MORE FRANTIC]

#### BAKER

And you're sure you didn't see who took him? 

#### NOOR

_(distraught, close to tears)_ By the time I got back to the shore, they were too far away! 

#### BAKER

Did you see a flag? 

#### NOOR

_(flustered)_ I don't know, I. I only got a glimpse --

#### BAKER

Anything you can remember --

#### NOOR

I --

#### BAKER

_(clearly also panicking)_ Anything at all -- how many guns? What did the prow look like? Describe the --

#### NOOR

I didn't see, because... _(voice cracking)_ I hid! 

##### [BEAT]

#### BAKER

_(extremely gentle)_ There now, child. You did right to hide. 

#### NOOR

I let them take him! 

#### BAKER

What were you going to do? Fight them with your bare hands? You may have muscles, but something tells me you didn't get them in combat. 

#### NOOR

No, but --

#### BAKER

It's a terrible thing, guilt. Terrible. And unhelpful. 

##### [IN THE DISTANCE, THUMPS ON A LADDER]

#### NOOR

Can you get him back? 

#### BAKER

That's not really up to me. That's a decision for --

##### [THE HATCH SWINGS OPEN WITH A DRAMATIC BANG] 

#### ALESTES

WHAT in the name of DAVID JONES' BARNACLE CRUSTED LOCKER is going on up here? Can a body not get some SLEEP without being woken by WAILING fit to rouse the DEAD --?

##### [ALESTES SPOTS NOOR]

Either you're new here or Siva has undergone a very dramatic transformation. 

#### NOOR

Yes, I --

##### [BAKER STEPS IN SMOOTHLY] 

#### BAKER

This is Noor, Captain. And they are extremely grateful for your permission to set foot aboard your ship. 

#### ALESTES

That's funny, I don't remember giving it to them. 

#### BAKER

_(careful)_ In light of the cargo they bring with them, I thought you would forgive me for speaking on your behalf. 

#### ALESTES

Oh you did, did you? Remind me to --

_(abruptly changing tack)_ What "cargo"?

#### BAKER

Supplies. And fresh ones at that. We won't be eating hardtack for a good long while.

##### [ALESTES CONSIDERS] 

#### ALESTES

I see. _(beat)_ Perhaps your insubordination can be overlooked, just this once. If that's all, I'm going back to bed. 

#### NOOR

Wait!

##### [BAKER SUCKS IN HIS BREATH. THIS IS NOT HOW TO TALK TO ALESTES.]

#### ALESTES

_(dangerous)_ What did you say? 

#### NOOR

Wait... Captain? 

#### BAKER

Someone's taken Siva. He and Noor went looking for food -- someone jumped him as they were leaving. 

#### ALESTES

_(to Noor)_ And why didn't they take you as well, new blood? Couldn't find a sack big enough?

##### [BAKER CONTINUES BEFORE NOOR HAS TO ANSWER THIS.]

#### BAKER

Noor saw Siva being rowed to another ship. Big -- bigger than ours. 

#### ALESTES

Not hard, is it?

_(audible shrug)_ Look. Clearly his British friends have taken the opportunity to haul him back to whatever kind of rough justice is waiting for him. I saved him once, I'm not doing it again! *Afternoon, all.*

#### BAKER

Alestes!

#### ALESTES

I'm not running a rescue service for nervous urchins.

#### NOOR

_(unsure)_ I do not believe it was a British ship. 

#### ALESTES

_(snort)_ And how do *you* know? 

##### [DISTANTLY, THE FLUTE ECHOES AGAIN]

#### NOOR

I heard a flute playing. Not a, a fife, a --

#### ALESTES

A bamboo flute. 

#### NOOR

Yes -- how did you --? 

#### ALESTES

_(of course it's her)_ Anh. 

##### [ANH'S FLUTE FADES INTO TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [THE BRIG OF ANH'S SHIP. MISERABLE, DRIPPING. A CONSTANT SCUM OF WATER ACROSS THE FLOOR SO ALL FOOTSTEPS SLAP MURKILY IN THE CRAMPED SPACE. OMINOUS CREAKING OF TIMBER AND A SKITTERING AND SQUEAK OF RATS.]

##### [SIVA IS TIED TO A BARREL, SITTING ON THE DAMP FLOOR. ANH THROWS A BUCKET OF WATER AT HIS FACE]

##### [SIVA GASPS AND SPLUTTERS] 

#### ANH

That's *Captain* Anh to you, scum! 

#### SIVA

Of course. Where -- _(coughs)_ where are my manners? 

#### ANH

Timid little thing, aren't you? Lying there soaked to the skin, not a drop of fight in you.

_(takes a breath)_ You know what you remind me of? A minnow. The kind of fish that's too small to even bother throwing back. 

#### SIVA

Now, I-I'm sure this can all be resolved civilly if we just remember our Ps and Qs --

##### [ANH THROWS ANOTHER BUCKET OF COLD WATER AT SIVA'S HEAD]

##### [SIVA GASPS FROM SHOCK AND COLD] 

Or no, we can do things your way! I see the wisdom now. 

#### ANH

Tell me everything you know, minnow. 

#### SIVA

Kn-know? 

#### ANH

About the Florists! 

#### SIVA

*Everything?* That could -- take a while. 

#### ANH

I've got all the time in the world. 

##### [BEAT]

#### SIVA

Well, I-I could start with the basic definition, I suppose, being the, the profession of those who sell and arrange flowers --

##### [SHING -- ANH HAS HER CUTLASS TO HIS NECK.]

_(strangulated)_ Urk.

#### ANH

Think. Very. Carefully. About what you say next. 

#### SIVA

Please -- I-I don't know what you want, or who you are!

##### [BEAT]

#### ANH

You really don't, do you? _(softer, put out)_ She hasn't mentioned me. 

#### SIVA

"Sh-she"? _(a gamble)_ Do you mean... Alestes?

##### [ANH SNARLS WITH RAGE] 

##### [SHE HURLS HER CUTLASS PAST SIVA'S EAR AT A ROOF BEAM, WHERE IT STICKS AND WOBBLES GENTLY TO AND FRO] 

#### ANH

*Never* say that name to me again, or next time, the cutlass goes through *you,* not the beam. 

##### [SHE RETRIEVES THE CUTLASS WITH A SHINK]

#### SIVA

You -- have some kind of history with Al -- _(catching himself)_ with... her? 

##### [ANH LETS OUT A LONG, BITTER LAUGH]

#### ANH

"History." You really are a little Brit, aren't you? Incapable of speaking in anything but frilly euphemisms. 

#### SIVA

You know, I do sympathise! Not to speak ill of one's captain but she can be very difficult at times --

#### ANH

Don't you *dare* speak of Alestes in that manner, you *unworthy* little --

##### [ANH STOPS, TAKES A DEEP BREATH, A SHAKY LAUGH. SHAKES IT OFF.]

Well. I've got you now, minnow. And if she wants you back -- she'll just have to come and see me, won't she?

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC: LIGHT DRUMS]

##### [THE GALLEY OF THE *NETAOANSOM.* AN ASSORTMENTS OF UTENSILS -- AND NOW, VARIOUS PRODUCE -- HANG DOWN FROM THE CEILING, SWAYING AS THE SHIP SAILS.]

##### [ALESTES SITS AT THE TABLE, CHOWING DOWN ON A BOWL OF FRUIT WHILE NOOR AND BAKER TOWER OVER HER.]

#### BAKER

Captain! 

#### ALESTES

_(mouth full)_ What?! 

#### BAKER

You can't just sit there and eat mango! 

#### ALESTES

_(mouth full)_ The hell I can't. 

#### BAKER

_(stern)_ Alestes.

##### [BEAT]

##### [ALESTES SWALLOWS NOISILY]

#### ALESTES

_(sulky)_ Yes? 

#### BAKER

It's *Anh.* She's not going to just -- go away. 

#### ALESTES

You know it's a trap, right? 

#### BAKER

Of course. 

#### ALESTES

An *insultingly obvious* trap? 

#### BAKER

_(lets out a breath)_ Are you angrier about the trap, or that she didn't put more effort into it --? 

#### ALESTES

That's enough out of you, old man. 

#### NOOR

_(sharp)_ You would speak to your elders *so* disrespectfully? 

#### ALESTES

Who are you anyway?

Don't answer, I don't care.

#### NOOR

Siva is being held *captive!* They might be torturing him, doing Allah knows what --

#### ALESTES

_(soothing)_ No, I shouldn't think so. 

#### NOOR

_(hope)_ No? 

#### ALESTES

No. He's probably already dead. 

#### BAKER

You know damn well the reason Anh took him is to get your attention. That makes this your problem.

#### ALESTES

So I should go and impale myself on her blade because it's, what, the decent thing to do? 

#### NOOR

You should go because I'll pay you.

##### [HEAVY SILENCE] 

#### ALESTES

_(slowly)_ Interesting. How much? 

#### NOOR

I don't have much in the way of... actual coin --

#### ALESTES

Pass. 

#### NOOR

But I'm strong. I can lift more than your friend here, and thrice as much as you, I'd wager. I brought you more food today than it seems you've seen in a *month.* You can have my labour. 

#### ALESTES

Don't need labour. Need coin.

#### NOOR

_(voice climbing)_ And how do you intend to get coin on a ship *you can't sail,* starving, half to death?

##### [NASTY SILENCE. NOOR'S GOT ALESTES, THOUGH SHE DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT IT.] 

#### ALESTES

...A year. 

#### NOOR

Three months. That's more than enough! 

#### ALESTES

Ten. 

#### NOOR

Six.

#### ALESTES

Six months... and those pretty bracelets you're wearing. 

#### NOOR

My --?

##### [JANGLING OF SAID BRACELETS]

*No!*

#### ALESTES

Poor Siva. I hear Anh keeps her knives sharp by skinning live rats she finds in the hold. 

#### NOOR

I cannot believe you would have me barter for the life of a living soul.

#### ALESTES

I'm not the one that sat back and watched the poor soul get dragged off.

##### [BEAT]

##### [ALESTES CONTINUES TO CHEW]

#### NOOR

_(beaten)_ Very well. 

##### [NOOR TAKES OFF THEIR BRACELETS AND PUTS THEM ON THE TABLE WITH A FINAL JANGLE.]

You had better get him back, "Captain." It is not wise to call down a debt like this unless you intend to pay it.

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [THE BRIG AS BEFORE. ANH IS TRYING TO DROWN OUT SIVA'S VOICE WITH HER FLUTE, UNSUCCESSFULLY.]

#### SIVA

_(voice fades in; has clearly been talking for a while)_ I just could not believe they didn't want to see my stamp collection! And then anyway... so then after they told me they had found my Nani in the wreckage... _(tearfully)_ Oon Nani aasirvatham oonaku eppotum erikkum. [Translation: Blessings will always burn for Nani.]

_(he sniffs)_ I'm sorry, I just -- you understand.

##### [THE FLUTE MAKES A DISCORDANT NOTE] 

#### ANH

_(bewildered, outraged)_ Do I?! 

#### SIVA

After that the British tried to *shoot* me, saying I was secretly a "Fly Fisher," which I really don't understand because I absolutely cannot fish, and I'm usually *very* good at getting along with people --

#### ANH

Good God can you *please* -- 

##### [MERCIFULLY, FROM THE CEILING ABOVE COME THREE LOUD BLOWS: ALESTES HAMMERING HER FIST ON THE BRIG TRAPDOOR.]

#### ALESTES

_(from above, muffled)_ Anh, you daughter of misery! Give me back my bilge-rat! 

#### ANH

_(to Siva)_ Oh, thank God. Mummy's here. 

#### ALESTES

Let me in this minute or I'll shoot this hatch to pieces! 

#### ANH

_(calling)_ It opens upwards, Alestes, you can let yourself in.

#### ALESTES

Ah. Yes. 

##### [THE HEAVY TRAPDOOR GROANS OPEN]

##### [ALESTES JUMPS DOWN INTO THE BRIG -- SPLASH!] 

#### ALESTES

Now: unhand him. 

#### ANH

_(mock-sweet)_ No time for pleasantries? After you went to all that trouble to find me?

#### ALESTES

You were moored a mile away in open water. You weren't exactly trying to hide. 

#### ANH

You can take the boy -- in fact, I'd be grateful if he never darkened my brig again.

#### ALESTES

But? 

#### ANH

_(singsong)_ There's a priiiice. 

#### ALESTES

Spit it out, then. _(as an afterthought)_ This isn't menacing, by the way. You're not... successfully menacing me. I barely had to maim *anyone* to get down here.

#### ANH

Are you done? 

#### ALESTES

Mhm.

#### ANH

I want something from you. 

#### ALESTES

Well, you're only human. 

#### ANH

A favour. 

#### ALESTES

A fav -- a *favour?*

##### [SHE BURSTS INTO FERAL LAUGHTER]

Ah, I needed that. _(tone shift)_ No. I won't do you a favour. _(laughingly)_ A favour is what you do for a friend. A favour would imply I *liked* you. I'll pay you a ransom for the hostage you took.

#### ANH

_(masking hurt)_ Semantics.

#### ALESTES

What do you need me to do?

#### ANH

You don't want me to spoil the surprise, do you?

#### ALESTES

Anh, I'm not playing this game. 

#### ANH

_(dropping the coyness)_ Entirely without game-playing, *he* hasn't decided yet.

#### ALESTES

_(suddenly fearful)_ "He"?

_(then, lightly)_ I should have known. None of this was your idea, was it? It's got his muddy paw prints all over it.

What if I say no?

#### ANH

Then I blow that little dinghy you call a "ship" out of the water. Can you afford to start again, I wonder?

##### [A TENSE SILENCE STRETCHES]

##### [AND THEN --]

#### SIVA

Achoo!

##### [A BIT OF A STUNNED PAUSE. WATER DRIPS]

Ooh. So sorry, how rude of me! I didn't meant to interrupt such a riveting conversation. You know, I think it's all this water I'm sitting in, I think in fact I might coming down with something? _(fearful)_ Possibly a grippe or --

#### ALESTES

Deal. 

#### ANH

_(audibly raising an eyebrow)_ You know, you do surprise me sometimes, Alestes, even now. 

#### ALESTES

_(takes a breath)_ Wish I could say the same of you. Hand him over. 

#### ANH

He's all yours. 

##### [ALESTES EASILY CUTS THROUGH SIVA'S BINDINGS.]

#### ALESTES

_(gruff)_ Come on, up the ladder. Let's go. 

#### ANH

Remember, Alestes. A favour. _(audibly smirking)_ Any time we like. 

##### [TRANSITIONAL MUSIC]

##### [NOOR SITTING ALONE IN THE GALLEY. BAKER ENTERS.]

#### NOOR

How is he? 

#### BAKER

Sleeping. He's had quite a day. And how are you?

##### [NOOR EXHALES.]

#### BAKER

You've had quite a day yourself.

...I saw the look on your face. Those bracelets were precious to you. 

#### NOOR

They were a gift, given when I... went away. _(voice cracking a little)_ They wanted me to remember them.

#### BAKER

That's a heavy thing to wear around your wrists. 

#### NOOR

Mm. 

#### BAKER

Heavier still to give it up for a boy you hardly know. 

#### NOOR

_(hadn't thought of it that way)_ I suppose. 

#### BAKER

Strange, what guilt can drive us to. 

#### NOOR

The words of a man with a story of his own. 

#### BAKER

Perhaps another day. It's not entirely my story to tell. 

#### NOOR

Alestes?

You never leave her side. 

#### BAKER

She needs someone. 

#### NOOR

"Strange, what guilt can drive us to." 

#### BAKER

_(a half-laugh)_ Hm. 

#### NOOR

You won't tell Siva, will you? 

#### BAKER

That's a conversation for you and the lad, I reckon.

Don't give up on getting your bracelets back, Noor. Alestes may drive a hard bargain, but -- you're part of the crew now. She'll warm up to you -- to both of you -- before you realise it, and before she does.
