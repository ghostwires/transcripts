Visitors, by Martin K.

> Unfamiliar circumstances have come knocking at my door.  
> Surprising from all angles.  
> Surprising from the darkness.
> 
> There's a woman at my door.
> 
> There's a woman at my door and she's insistent wanting in,  
> But she is outside.
> 
> Outsider.
> 
> Lots of outsiders are on the other side of my door
> 
> Knocking.
> 
> Knocking.
> 
> Crawling, crawling  
> Seeking, seeking
> 
> I cannot welcome you in, strange visitors,  
> I cannot make you a cup of tea,  
> If you're the woman I think you to be
> 
> You'll have to stay outside my door  
> And I will stay within.
> 
> Why do you stay there outside my door?  
> No words to speak of.  
> Yet silver syllables are trying to breach my door.
> 
> Are you waiting for something?  
> Are you waiting for someone?  
> Someone special to let you in?
> 
> Because that someone isn't me.  
> I am safe in my sanctum,  
> Patience is my friend.  
> For now I can resist you,  
> I am strong enough to handle this.
> 
> But I do wish I had another door.

Yonder, by K. Blackwood.

> I spy, with my little eye, something beginning with Y.
> 
> I'll give you a clue it moves with a fluid grace  
> Moving down then up, unravelling a thread behind it.
> 
> Bulbous in its form  
> Spun with method and the instinct of far less years than I,  
> And yet it spins in the wind.  
> Buffeted by forces it cannot see  
> And nature beyond its control
> 
> Though;
> 
> You probably cannot see it,  
> Even though you definitely have the vantage.
> 
> Do you have eyes out there while you stand guard on me?  
> On the kid whirling with their yoyo, casting wild and free.
> 
> Though perhaps I should have chosen yonder.  
> Staring out the window at the places I cannot go.  
> Forced to consider an overlooked view.  
> I must concentrate to see, and take stock of what might be
> 
> I can survey my domain, limited as it is and confidently say:
> 
> B is for a well read book  
> P is for some paper  
> K is for the knitted blanket, a childhood wrapped in patchwork, stitched with cares and love  
> W is for the wisdom of my peers  
> and T is for the thought that my colleagues wouldn't be here.
> 
> I spy, with my little eye, something beginning with H;  
> H is for the Hope that all my friends are safe.

Filed Away, by M. K. B.

> Down amongst the boxes, hidden well, not hiding  
> Holding fast against the forces of darkness pressing in on --
> 
> Darkness.
> 
> Paper words security, certified and filed.  
> Words to explain the darkness,  
> Explain the need for resting amidst the weights of statements  
> A comforting, centuries heaviness.
> 
> Experiences in words, words in boxes, boxes on shelves.  
> Shelves in order, everything in its place.  
> Where it ought to be.
> 
> Filed.  
> For future consultation.  
> End of an era consideration.  
> Threads abound, surround, linked to might in volume to be found  
> Hidden strength in knowledge,  
> Kept hidden from the darkness.  
> Secret weapons in the darkness.  
> Everything is filed in places and all is right with the world.
> 
> Only it's not.
> 
> Is it.

Draw State, by Blackwood Esq.

> I spy, with my little eye, something about to go *snap.*
> 
> There's a limit to patience between the cat and the mouse, trapped as they are in limbo.
> 
> A treasure hunt without a clue,  
> Monopoly on time and mind.  
> Masterminding our status quo,  
> Life between crosswords and crossed swords,  
> A supe'natural blind-man's bluff
> 
> I wonder if they've got home safely?  
> Rounded the bases and not got tagged by silver bullets seeking ingress.  
> Somehow this charade needs to end.  
> I'm tired of being alone in the dark.
