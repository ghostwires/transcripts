Streets, by Martin K. Blackwood.

> The streets are hard in London.  
> Paved in old secrets, the hot smell after the rains.  
> The threads of people walking,
> 
> Living.
> 
> Loving.
> 
> Walking the paths of lives unseen,  
> Living in a world of unknown roads,  
> Loving amidst the shadows of choices,  
> Stretching like silk into the future.
> 
> Paths of good intention.
> 
> Leading somewhere.
> 
> Anywhere.
> 
> To shake off the dirt underfoot  
> And stand.  
> In the streets.  
> Looking up.  
> Taking notice.
> 
> Being seen.

_(whispered)_ Yeah...

A Country Walk, by M. K. Blackwood.

> I think I'd like to wander lonely as a cloud,  
> Get out of London and into the country,  
> Lose the streetlamps and the high rises.
> 
> Leave the tangled loves and lives behind,   
> And learn to weave a new way.  
> A quieter way in hill and dale.
> 
> A greener life to all the senses,  
> Daffodils and buttercup and willow boughs,  
> Scenting shelter away from the hurly burley of strifes  
> Looking out of lurking windows.
> 
> There's a lot to be hoped for beyond the limits  
> If I could float out into the wilds.  
> Because the city cannot confine a cloud.

Biscuits, by M. K. B.

> There's a game we play every week,  
> Break time rounds of hide and seek.  
> Playground games move to the workplace,  
> Now with smiles and far less pace.
> 
> Breaking the rules with ones of our own,  
> Friendly misdirection that we hone.  
> Under tea towels or back of a drawer;  
> Once in the depths of the stationary store!
> 
> Admin and researcher, battle of wits  
> Seeking the edge of calling it quits  
> Never quite there, at least not as yet  
> More than just biscuits; our battlefield set.
> 
> The others might think we're wasting our time  
> But lightening the mood's not that heinous a crime.

Rains, by Mr. Blackwood.

> Up high, above it all, clouds hold the promise of rain with potential.  
> Carry the promise of waters to wash away the marks that everything bears.  
> The rains seek release in downpours and outbursts an...

> ...the rains seek release in downpours and outbursts,  
> Expressed when the weather turns to action.  
> Pouring out, tumbling down, spilling forth.  
> The sharpness and the purity fall  
> Acquires new character on the descent,  
> Comes into contact with ideas of the environment.  
> Picks up pollutants as it slides down surfaces.  
> Clarity clouded as it condenses.  
> Potential now tarnished in gutter overflow.
> 
> And poor incy wincy is washed out.
