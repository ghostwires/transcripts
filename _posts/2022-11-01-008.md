##### [SHOW THEME -- INTRO] 

#### MARY

Rusty Quill Presents: *Trice Forgotten.*

Episode Eight: A Rigged Game.

##### [THEME FADES OUT]

##### [EXT. KALITIVU -- PORT MARKET]

##### [THE CREW (BAR BAKER) IS TOGETHER, WAITING IN A QUEUE -- SOMETHING IS SIZZLING ON THE OTHER END]

#### SIVA

_(voice fading in)_ Oh, oh, oh! And then on the *East* side of the island --

#### INEZ

No offence, Siva, but --

#### SIVA

-- there's this *huge* rock that artists go to sit on! Have done for decades --

#### INEZ

_(annoyed)_ Siva. 

#### ALESTES

There's no use trying to cut him off. Once he gets like this, he just keeps going.

#### SIVA

-- they sit on the coast and paint, then sell their --

#### INEZ

Siva! 

#### SIVA

Oh, er -- yes? 

#### INEZ

You've been talking about Kalitivu *non-stop* since we got here. 

#### ALESTES

You'll learn to start drowning it out eventually. 

#### INEZ

Shouldn't a mapmaker know to leave us something to discover on our own?! 

#### NOOR

I don't believe that you're making the point that you're trying to make. 

#### INEZ

What? 

#### NOOR

A cartographer is the last person who would want to leave anything to be discovered by someone else.

#### SIVA

Of course! Cartographers are *discoverers.* 

#### INEZ

What's the last thing that you discovered, Siva?

#### SIVA

Well! There's -- _(struggling)_ the -- I was just saying about the rock? With the artists? And then there's this route, up by the --

#### INEZ

Urgh! 

#### NOOR

Inez, if you don't have anything nice to say...

#### INEZ

This William is *clearly* a no-show. Let's grab what we need to re-provision and get going. 

#### SIVA

But I haven't even shown you the --

#### INEZ

Didn't you say you were nearly shot by British soldiers the last time you were here? 

#### SIVA

Yes? 

#### INEZ

How do we know William isn't one of them? Luring you here? 

#### SIVA

_(chuckles)_ That was all a big misunderstanding. And anyway, they're not all like that, Inez. All of my friends -- excepting you of course -- are British. 

#### ALESTES

Some friends.

##### [A BAMBOO FLUTE ON THE WIND. NOBODY TAKES NOTE OF IT.]

##### [ADVIKA MOVES PAST THE CREW, BRUSHING AGAINST ALESTES.] 

#### ADVIKA

_(seductive)_ You feel like... rowing a boat, Captain? 

#### ALESTES

Depends on the boat. 

#### ADVIKA

Moving gently down the stream... 

#### ALESTES

I prefer to really put my back into it. 

#### SIVA

A-are those code words? _(gasps)_ Pirate code-words! 

#### INEZ

We'll tell you when you're older. 

#### ADVIKA

Hm. See you at the Jolly Jan, *Captain.*

##### [ADVIKA MOVES AWAY FROM THEM]

#### SIVA

Was that a friend? A *pirate* friend?! 

##### [A CLAP ON THE SHOULDER]

#### ALESTES

Inez, you're in charge.

#### INEZ

Excuse me? 

#### ALESTES

I've got some... "business," to attend to. Keep the blathering fool safe. 

#### INEZ

Security?! That is not my job -- _(breathes out)_ This is no time to be gallivanting at the Jolly damned Jan!

#### ALESTES

This is the perfect time to gallivant!

##### [ALESTES LEAVES] 

#### SIVA

Do you think we should order enough for her? In case she comes back with her friend?

#### INEZ

I... doubt we'll be seeing much of her the rest of the day. 

#### SIVA

Oh! Right. So -- _(to the seller, in Tamil)_ Naalu parimaanum, tayavu ceytu mama. [Translation: Four servings please, uncle.]

##### [FOUR SERVINGS ARE BAGGED AND HANDED OUT]

#### SIVA

One for you, and you, aaaaand a portion to take back for Baker! 

#### INEZ

Hm. _(chews)_ Surprisingly good. 

#### SIVA

Oh! You know what goes well with this? That stall across the way sells the best -- here, stay here! --

##### [SIVA SKIPS AWAY]

#### INEZ

...So? 

#### NOOR

So? 

#### INEZ

Do you like him, or what? 

#### NOOR

Of course I *like* him. 

#### INEZ

_(snorts)_ Oh, come on. Don't be obtuse.

##### [NOOR DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING] 

Ugh. Fine. Keep it to yourself. But stringing him on like this isn't kind. 

#### NOOR

You are on his side now?

#### INEZ

"Sides."

It's painful to watch him give you those damned puppy-dog eyes. Either kiss him, or turn him down.

#### NOOR

Inez... 

#### INEZ

What? Now's the perfect chance. Might as well deal the final blow at the same time as he realises a kid like him will never actually make it at a museum like --

##### [SIVA BOUNDS UP, ALONG WITH MARY]

#### SIVA

Inez, Noor, this is -- oh. I forgot to ask for your name!

#### MARY

You may call me Mary. 

#### SIVA

Mr Blair sent Ms Mary to collect me! We were waiting on the wrong side of the road, like silly geese!

#### INEZ

_(drawled)_ Uh-huh.

It didn't say in the letter what the job posting was.

#### MARY

Did it not?

#### INEZ

It didn't. Perhaps you could expand on that?

#### MARY

Of course. When Mr Blair mentioned a person of Siva's... experience, I *was* rather surprised. But the Museum is in dire straits, and desperately needs a cartographer of his calibre to restore maps that would otherwise be lost.

#### INEZ

I didn't know your lot *had* a map department.

#### MARY

We are all about preservation.

#### SIVA

Preservation? I'd be good at that!

#### INEZ

Half your clothes are stained with food, Siva.

#### NOOR

He is truly skilled. It is almost miraculous, his way with maps.

#### INEZ

What's miraculous is how long he's stayed alive.

#### MARY

Mr Blair can explain more about the post in person.

#### NOOR

Can we accompany him?

#### MARY

You? *All* of you? Whatever for?

#### NOOR

We've had a fair few run-ins with unsavoury people, and letting him wander off alone...

#### MARY

This is, unfortunately, a delicate and *private* matter.

#### SIVA

That's what Lieutenant-Colonel Shaw used to say! _(affecting a deep voice)_ "Cartography is a delicate, intricate matter, and above all, must be treated with *ultimate* confidentiality."

#### MARY

Yes, Shaw is... known, for his wisdom in such things.

#### SIVA

You know the Lieutenant-Colonel?

#### MARY

We are very much acquainted.

#### INEZ

This Shaw... he's someone you trust?

#### SIVA

He's the one who promoted me!

#### NOOR

And Siva would just be going to talk with Mr Blair?

#### MARY

Iron out a few details, do a few test maps, that kind of thing.

#### INEZ

And if he decides that the job isn't for him?

#### MARY

We'll return him right back to your ship.

Not to put too fine a point on this, but I cannot be certain how long this opportunity will last. Siva is very skilled, of course, but hardly the only cartographer the Queen's Museum has access to.

#### INEZ

I see. Well, Siva? Up to you.

#### SIVA

Noor, could I have a moment of your time?

#### NOOR

Of course. 

#### SIVA

In... private?

#### NOOR

Oh. Er. Sure.

##### [INEZ WOLF-WHISTLES TO HIMSELF]

##### [NOOR AND SIVA WALK A FEW PACES AWAY] 

#### SIVA

Noor... what do you think? 

#### NOOR

I think that it is up to you.

But, if you do get the position, I have no doubt you will do wonderfully. 

#### SIVA

...Is that -- _(exhales)_ I've been...

Baker told me that people don't really say what they actually mean, which makes me confused, sometimes. 

#### NOOR

You... have a question for me. 

#### SIVA

Would you feel nothing but joy if I were to leave you, Noor? 

#### NOOR

I think... _(choosing their words carefully)_ that this job is something that you have wanted for a long time, akhi. It is not worth giving up for someone you met a *month* ago. 

#### SIVA

...You didn't answer my question. 

#### NOOR

Should you get the job, Siva, I would feel nothing but pride for my friend in his new venture. 

##### [A BEAT]

#### SIVA

I -- see. ...Thank you for your honesty.

##### [THEY REJOIN INEZ AND MARY]

Right. Yes. Yes! Just a talk! Yes, I think I shall go with you, Ms Mary. 

#### MARY

Very good. 

#### SIVA

Noor, Inez? I want to make sure Nani knows I was here. Could you go to her, and pay your respects for me?

#### INEZ

It wasn't top of my list --

##### [NOOR ELBOWS INEZ]

Ow, *Noor!* Yes, fine. Of course we will. 

#### SIVA

Are you sure you'll be alright by yourselves? I could --

#### NOOR

Don't worry about us. Go! Do well. We'll see you later. 

#### MARY

Ready? 

#### SIVA

...Yes. Yes, I'm ready. 

##### [INT. JOLLY JAN TAVERN]

##### [BUSTLING NOISES OF PATRONS, ARGUMENTS, CLINKING GLASSES]

##### [ALESTES BEGINS ASCENDING THE FLIGHT OF STAIRS TO THE SECOND FLOOR]

#### ADVIKA

I sure hope you're not the type that's all bark and no bite. 

#### ALESTES

That's your first impression of me? 

#### ADVIKA

Mm, plenty of people thought they could handle *this* before... and let's just say I was underwhelmed. 

#### ALESTES

Sounds like fighting talk to me --

##### [A DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

#### ANH

Hello Alestes.

##### [ANH PASSES COINS TO ADVIKA]

Thank you, sweetheart. 

#### ADVIKA

A pleasure, as always.

##### [ADVIKA CLOSES THE DOOR ON HER WAY OUT] 

##### [A BEAT OF SILENCE]

#### ALESTES

Really? You couldn't have written an address in your letter? 

#### ANH

Where's the fun in that? And it got you away from your old man and those brats, didn't it? Thought you might want to spare them the nitty-gritty, just like in the good old days.

#### ALESTES

We've had our differences, Anh, but we could decide to put that behind us and talk like adults.

#### ANH

There are far more than *differences* between us. You're a traitor, I'm not. It's that simple.

#### ALESTES

"A traitor." Still such a loyal *pet.* 

#### ANH

"Pet"! Oh, Alestes. You do test me sometimes. _(laughs)_ I've missed this. I've missed you. And I want you *dead,* so I can miss you even more. Funny how that works.

#### ALESTES

Should have known better than to lead with politeness. Go on then, the quicker you get it out, the quicker we can be done. 

#### ANH

The longer I draw this out, the more frustrated that face of yours gets.

Fine. Here. Look.

##### [ANH SPREADS A MAP ACROSS THE TABLE] 

I've searched these parts of Kalitivu thoroughly, and still the mice elude me. Chewing holes in our gunpowder storage. Looting cargo. 

#### ALESTES

Mice? 

#### ANH

Wannabe rebels. Call themselves the "Fly Fishers."

#### ALESTES

You can't handle a local gang yourself anymore? 

#### ANH

They've been watching us too long -- their leader, Johana, she knows our movements. So I'm switching in a new cat. You can start with the spots I haven't crossed out. 

#### ALESTES

Where'd you get this map? 

#### ANH

Why, do you know something about it? 

#### ALESTES

Markings looked familiar, is all. ...But I look at plenty of maps, no surprise there. 

#### ANH

We think this map was created by someone close to Johana. The tactical information on it matches strikes against us. 

#### ALESTES

The mapmaker might have been a Fly Fisher rebel? 

#### ANH

It's likely. That or someone with a bone to pick against Gammon. 

#### ALESTES

What would a local rebel group have against a pirate? 

#### ANH

They must have thought we were operating out of the Governor's estate, got the British to do a raid, but they only killed a few maidservants.

#### ALESTES

Where are you operating out from? 

#### ANH

Oh, you'll *have* to do better than that, my dear.

That should be everything you need. Find Johana, and find her quickly. Drag her before Gammon, dead or alive, and then: we're even. 

#### ALESTES

Understood.

##### [ALESTES ROLLS UP THE MAP] 

#### ANH

"Understood"?!

#### ALESTES

_(flat)_ Understood. 

#### ANH

That's... it? I give you a command, and you just -- do it?

#### ALESTES

That's usually how these things work. 

#### ANH

No, not -- not between *us,* not...

Where's your fight?

#### ALESTES

I'll see you around, Anh.

##### [HIGH STRINGS]

##### [INT. NANI'S HOME -- AFTERNOON]

##### [NOOR AND INEZ ENTER] 

#### NOOR

You're sure this is the right house? 

#### INEZ

I wouldn't hear the end of it if I couldn't follow his damned instructions.

##### [CLINKING, CRUMBLING NOISES, AS THOUGH STEPPING OVER RUBBLE]

#### NOOR

He didn't say that his home had been...

Inez, please, show a little respect for the dead. 

#### INEZ

You think I'm going to be haunted, just because I'm looking around? 

#### NOOR

Inez.

#### INEZ

_(sighs)_ Alright, alright. Looks like people rougher than us have had a good rummage anyway. 

#### NOOR

The soldiers looking for Siva, maybe?

##### [A PAUSE]

It makes me uncomfortable, sometimes. He makes me uncomfortable.

#### INEZ

Siva?

#### NOOR

He is... bright. Like -- when he is looking at me, he is seeing the ghost of -- this home. His smile... it feels... heavy. Too heavy for me.

#### INEZ

Mm.

#### NOOR

_(a sigh)_ ...Let us pay our respects. 

#### INEZ

I don't even know what the woman looked like. 

#### NOOR

We are in her house, and we know the person she raised. That's enough. 

#### INEZ

...Fine. 

#### NOOR

Oh Allah, forgive Nani, and elevate her station among those who are guided. Send her along the path of those who came before, and forgive us and her, oh Lord of the worlds...

Enlarge for her her grave, and shed light upon her in it.

##### [INT. SMALL TEA SHOP -- EVENING]

##### [THE DOORCHIME SOUNDS; ALESTES ENTERS] 

#### ALESTES

You. 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Er, what can I do for you, ...miss?

#### ALESTES

I need information. 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

All we sell here is tea! _(laughs)_ So... 

#### ALESTES

Tea. 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

It is a tea shop. Here. I have the perfect blend for you.

##### [THE RATTLE OF CUTLERY AND CUPS] 

#### ALESTES

I don't have *time* for --

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Try it. Won't disappoint.

##### [ALESTES SIGHS]

##### [POURING NOISES]

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Green cardamom, cinnamon stripped *right* around the corner, jaggery, and buffalo milk.

##### [ALESTES TAKES A SIP]

#### ALESTES

It's good. But it won't distract me from what I need to know.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

As I said, I don't know much. 

#### ALESTES

The thing is, I don't believe you. 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

No, I *really* -- don't actually --

#### ALESTES

Running a shop like this, people passing through, a plantation worth of workers gathering tea on their breaks, and you don't have *any* information sitting between those ears of yours?

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

I-I just run my shop! _(laughs, increasingly nervously)_ Try to keep my customers happy, and tend to my family.

#### ALESTES

So you know nothing about a woman named Johana? Nothing about Lord Graham's raided estate? The Fly Fishers?

##### [THE TEA SHOP QUIETS]

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

I don't know anything that can help you.

#### ALESTES

Judging by the colour draining from your face, and the tremble in your hand, I'd say you were lying.

But who am I to say. I'm just a stranger.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Yes, yes -- a *stranger,* who doesn't know about this island, doesn't know the people *here,* and I --

#### ALESTES

But who does know how to make people start telling the truth.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

No no no. You don't understand --

#### ALESTES

Five.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Wait, just wait.

#### ALESTES

Truly delicious stuff. Four --

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

There's nothing that I can do to help you!

#### ALESTES

Three.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Are you listening to me? I said that I can't --

#### ALESTES

Two.

##### [ALESTES PUTS HER PISTOL ON THE TABLE] 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

_(whimpers; voice rising:)_ There are things at stake here beyond --

#### ALESTES

-- your life?!

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Beyond my life.

#### ALESTES

A shame.

##### [THE HAMMER COCKS. THE TEA SHOP OWNER WHIMPERS AGAIN]

Tell me where to find Johana. 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

F-*find* her? But -- you've already killed her. 

#### ALESTES

Killed her?

##### [ALESTES TAPS THE GUN AGAINST THE TABLE] 

*Johana?*

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Yes. She was killed in the raid!

#### ALESTES

I thought only maidservants got killed in the raid.

##### [A BEAT. TWO PUZZLE PIECES CONNECT.]

Johana was a servant. How better to keep tabs than to be invisible.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

You're not... you're not a British enforcer? 

#### ALESTES

Do I look like I'm a British damned enforcer? The rebels, the Fly Fishers. Who's second in command?

You said you had a family.

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

There's nobody, I -- she kept everything to herself -- _(breathing hard)_ we think she told her plans to her grandson, but he ran away -- nobody's seen him since!

##### [ANOTHER BEAT.]

#### ALESTES

Skinny. About this tall? 

#### TEA SHOP OWNER

Yes. Yes, yes, the mapmaker --

#### ALESTES

Oh for *fuck's* sake. 

##### [EXT. DENSE FOREST -- EVENING]

##### [SIVA AND MARY ARE MOVING THROUGH A DENSE FOREST] 

#### SIVA

Are we almost there? 

#### MARY

Just a little further. 

#### SIVA

I believe you, I do. It's just, you said it was only a little further some time ago now, and I'm growing quite parched. Are you thirsty? I'm terribly thirsty.

#### MARY

I'm sure Mr Blair will have *plenty* for you to drink when we arrive. 

#### SIVA

And where *are* we going? The shops are all in town, and it makes more sense to stay closer to the port, doesn't it? Easier to ship antiquities back and forth. Out here there's only --

#### MARY

Perhaps you'll be less thirsty if you *talked* less.

#### SIVA

Right. Yes. Of course.

##### [THE SILENCE ONLY LASTS TWO SECONDS]

This really is a trek, isn't it. You can't mean to tell me that you walk this route every single day! Talk about "off the beaten track," this isn't even a path that I've mapped, and I've mapped every single inch of this place! Look at how thick those trees are -- so easy to get turned around without any source of light... And in this humidity. I forgot how hot it gets here, even in the pitch-dark of night! Just *astoundingly* sticky, the type of sticky heat my grandmother used to --

#### MARY

Siva. Would you just. For a moment. Be... quiet.

#### SIVA

Did I say something wrong --?

#### MARY

If you don't shut up, I'm going to kill you, and then *all* my plans are ruined.

##### [SILENCE]

##### [SIVA BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER]

#### SIVA

Oh Ms Mary! You really are quite the jokester! Yes, the heat and the humidity does get the tension up, doesn't it! One gets so irritable out here. Kill me, you say. Don't you worry, you'll have a return of spirits once we're in the shade.

##### [EXT. *NETAOANSOM* -- DECK -- EVENING]

##### [THE SOUNDS OF THE WAVES HITTING THE SIDES OF THE SHIP. A BUSY PORT.]

##### [NOOR AND INEZ WALK UP THE GANGWAY.]

#### BAKER

Noor, help me lower this cargo into the hold. Inez, you go down and start sorting the goods.

#### NOOR

That is... an impressive amount of food. Is the Captain planning on an ocean voyage, no safe harbour in sight?

#### INEZ

Don't tempt fate, Noor.

#### BAKER

Where's the Captain?

#### INEZ

Brothel.

#### BAKER

_(groans)_ At a time like this -- Inez, you run to the... to bring back the Captain. Noor, you help me here.

#### NOOR

Is everything alright?

#### BAKER

Everything is *fine.* Nothing to worry about. 

#### INEZ

Nothing to worry about, let's just pack up six months' worth of provisions?

#### BAKER

Siva -- did he give an idea of when --

#### NOOR

Baker. We can't help if we don't know what we're running from. 

##### [BAKER SIGHS]

#### BAKER

There, on the horizon. See that flag? 

#### INEZ

The one dripping red? 

#### BAKER

*The Galloping Englishman.*

#### NOOR

*The Galloping* -- Gammon's ship? 

#### INEZ

So there's a ship on the horizon, who cares? 

#### BAKER

I care! Listen, that's not just a ship of Gammon's, it's *the* ship. It means just beyond him is a fleet of ships, full of men as ruthless as he is.

I'm all for standing and fighting, believe you me, but I don't believe in fighting to lose. And right now, we'd not just lose, we'd be *destroyed.*

#### NOOR

I don't understand, why are they --

#### WILLIAM

Helllooooooo? Hello? Anyone up there?

##### [WILLIAM WALKS UP THE GANGWAY] 

Oh! There you are! What scary expressions, I hope I'm not being a bother. 

#### INEZ

You are.

#### BAKER

Now is not a good time, sir. 

#### WILLIAM

_(oblivious)_ Ha ha! So sorry, but I recognised the ship. N-E-T-A-O-A-N-S-O-M! Is Siva here? 

#### BAKER

Who's looking? 

#### WILLIAM

William Henry Baker Blair -- I believe I'm already acquainted with your big friend over there. 

#### NOOR

Siva's not with you? 

#### WILLIAM

Why would he be with me? 

#### NOOR

Because your... Ms Mary came to collect him. Found us in the market, said she worked with you.

#### WILLIAM

The only Mary I know is the Virgin, I'm afraid! 

#### INEZ

I knew it! I knew it, and I *told* you --

#### WILLIAM

Oh, hold on -- did this, er, Mary have brownish hair, an expression like she sucks eggs for a living? 

#### INEZ

*Yes.*

#### WILLIAM

Ooh, dear. 

#### NOOR

You know her? 

#### WILLIAM

I'm not one to speak ill of anyone, least of all a Lady, but... Mary Peters, there's... well. Let's just say there's no place for a Lady at the Queen's Museum, least of all one like her! 

##### [EXT. DENSE FOREST -- NIGHT]

#### MARY

Here we are. 

#### SIVA

Goodness, I really was turned around. This is -- Governor Graham's house! 

##### [A DOOR ROLLS OPEN, THEN SHUT]

##### [FOOTSTEPS]

I wasn't aware that Mr Blair was so close to Governor Graham. Has the Governor returned? Or is he renting the place to the Museum in his absence?

#### MARY

For how long would you say you've been making maps? 

#### SIVA

Oh, since I could hold a quill! Nani always made sure I had plenty of things to practise with. Ink, paper, places to map -- places I had seen and I knew, places I hadn't seen on any other map. I like going into detail, they said that's why I'm so good.

#### MARY

Good enough to sell? 

#### SIVA

Not yet, and certainly not for lack of trying. You would not *believe* how terribly rude this one shopkeeper...

#### MARY

What kind of places do you like to put on your maps? Places your Nani took you to? She must have taken you all over. To those places you say aren't on any other maps.

Were there any places she told you to *never,* no matter what, give away the location of?

##### [FOOTSTEPS STOP]

#### SIVA

_(audible frown)_ No, my maps were -- are -- perfect. If it exists on this island, it's reflected in my work.

Is this Mr Blair's office? It's very... er... closed-off. No windows either -- this won't be very good for...

Er... maps do look best in the natural light.

...Are you... not going to come in, Ms Mary? 

#### MARY

This has been *very* informative, Siva. That'll be all for now. 

##### [THE DOOR CLOSES]

#### SIVA

Ms Mary?

##### [THE BOLTS OF A LOCK THUD SHUT] 

Ms Mary? Er, excuse me, Ms Mary? You seem to have locked the door!

Oh, no.

I've been bloody kidnapped again, haven't I.
