#### RILEY

What if we missed it? What if everybody else did wake up, took off to rebuild on some distant world. What if we've been left behind? 

#### ANNOUNCER

From the creators of The Magnus Archives, comes a new horror podcast. Subscribe to Neon Inkwell to join us on humankind's last hope, the Ozymandias generation ship.

#### COMPUTER

Humanity's will to survive and explore has triumphed over the vastness of space. And now we will triumph over time, with the Ozymandias project...

##### [The computer's voice fades until it's underneath the dialogue below.]

#### LEVI

Grrr! 

#### RILEY

Hey, hey! Careful! 

#### LUNA

Levi? Are you alright? 

#### RILEY

Remember last time, when one of these things caught fire? 

#### LEVI

None of this makes any damn sense! We were supposed to wake up together. All of us! 

#### RILEY

Maybe the system decided to stagger it? 

#### LEVI

No, it wouldn't work like that. There are meant to be thousands of us, hundreds of thousands, all at once. 

#### ANNOUNCER

What if you awoke, only to discover your future was already sabotaged?

#### LEVI

What's wrong? 

#### MIRA

There's, uh, a lot of the stuff in here is... broken. 

#### RILEY

That's not broken. That's smashed. 

##### [The music shifts]

#### MIRA

How old is it? 

#### ZACK

Old. 

#### MIRA

Anything more specific? 

#### ZACK

Only that no one could lose this much blood and live. 

#### ANNOUNCER

And in our search for a new home, what if something truly monstrous finds us first?

##### [Whistles apparent, music builds to climax]

#### MIRA

You hear it too, don't you? 

#### LEVI

Don't move. 

#### ZACK

Mira, what do we do? 

#### MIRA

RUN!

##### [Transition music to:]
