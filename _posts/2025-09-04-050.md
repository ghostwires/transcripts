##### [Intro Theme]

#### ANNOUNCER

Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus Protocol.

Episode Fifty -- Deep Trouble.

##### [Music]

##### [Click]

##### [Two sets of cautious footsteps in the zone, which sounds more active than normal]

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Nothing. Clear?

##### [WARDEN OLIVIA pushes a metal bucket with her foot to look beneath it]

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

Clear. 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(into radio)_ Quadrant Bravo, section fourteen, clear. 

#### MELANIE

_(from radio)_ Copy team three. Proceed to section thirteen. 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Copy.

##### [They keep moving slowly] 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

So you hoping to find it or miss it? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

What d'you mean? 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

Feels good to bag a horror, but this sounds rough. So would you rather get the credit or steer clear? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Depends how it feels about getting shot. 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

You might be in luck then. Rumour is this one used to be human.

##### [They continue to sweep the area]

##### [The Archivist, unnoticed, manifests alongside them] 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Rumour is this one used to be a very *particular* human. 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

Ah you heard that too, eh? You believe it? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

I dunno. I hope not, but they're using the A word, so it's definitely not nothing. 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

Mm. 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Feel like we'd know if he was back, though. Like it would feel different. 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

Different? Different how? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

Like the world was ending again.

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

It doesn't feel like that to you?

##### [The Archivist engulfs Warden Callum. Warden Olivia doesn't notice.]

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

I mean, I've never seen the zone this bad. Not since right after Towerfall. Even then you could generally believe what you were seeing. Now... I dunno.

You recognize that door? The one with the peephole? 'Cause I've patrolled this section for years and I don't recognize it. I'm not even going near it because I know if I turn my head this way and back... Yup. It's gone. Just another mirage. So yeah, it does kind of feel...

Callum?

##### [Nothing.]

_(into radio)_ Callum, sitrep. Do you copy? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio)_ I'm down... Deep down... 

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

_(into radio)_ Callum, thank Christ, are you --

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio, droning)_ ...Down below the waves that crash above in roiling icy walls --

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

_(realising)_ Shit! Callum!

#### WARDEN CALLUM

-- that reach for ships to bend and curl and drag to the cold black depths --

#### WARDEN OLIVIA

_(into recorder)_ Control, this is --

##### [There are three gunshots and then WARDEN OLIVIA dies. Bitten by fog with teeth.]

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio, droning)_ -- but it is nothing to me, in my iron tomb that cruises sleek and deadly through the brine...

I am in my cell, my bunk, my bed that presses up so hard against the icy metal of the bulkhead that no more than an inch of rust-pocked steel stands between the crushing abyss and my tiny, shivering body.

And I do shiver as the pressure builds and the captain's voice drones from the squat speakers in the shadowed corners of every compartment. It is distorted, cracking, but I know he is demanding loyalty over and over.

The sound vibrates the tinpot medal on my chest, and blood oozes from the holes the pins punched into my skin when they stuck it there, for my dutiful service.

My duty is on the bridge, the command deck, the wheelhouse. I am to sit at the radio and call for help, call for orders, call for anyone to hear us through countless fathoms of dark water and infinite miles of empty air.

The captain will stare at me with his empty sockets and when he tears the tannoy mouthpiece from his jaw with a wet tearing pop, he will swap to dictating messages through his bloody saliva. Messages that will not be received and cannot be replied to. Messages that make no sense and simply scream of Poseidon, of Neptune, of Mazu, of Leviathan, of Susanoo, of wet and sightless water gods I do not know but which tremble through my stomach when I am forced to repeat the names into empty radio waves.

Test of the crew scuttle and crawl across their stations, doing their duty in the thick red light. Sometimes one of them will approach the periscope. They will put their faces to the hungry eyepiece and then they will begin to scream. You cannot see their eyes behind the metal tube, but you can hear them being taken. Then the skull begins to crack and implode gradually crushing itself into a thin pink paste as it feeds itself into the periscope. Then the torso, shoulders, arms, going all the way down. The order is different each time, but it always ends the same, with the gorged periscope dragging itself contentedly up into the dark, sated for a while.

I do not know our mission, although sometimes the missiles whisper to me in my sleep. They want me to come to them, to open them, to take their payloads into my heart. They can help, they say. They can keep me safe. I want to believe them, but my flesh melts when I embrace them, and it sticks to their hulls when I pull myself away.

When we reach our destination the mission will begin, and we will do something terrible. Something unforgivable. Something that will scar our souls in ways that will leave us other than human. But unless someone answers my hopeless calls for new orders, the only thing that can stop us is a mine or a depth charge.

If that happens, a terrible, wounding vibration will shove through the submarine. The sound deafening inside and echoing through the water outside. Those closest will be killed instantly to the envy of all. The rest of us will flee in this sealed tube crying out for mother's love and salvation as the pressure spikes and water tears and the doors buckle from the icy fist of the deep ocean. Doors that stay just sturdy enough to imprison those who fell behind, who lingered a second too long in morbid fascination of their doom. Not sturdy enough to muffle their cries for help that linger long after they have drowned and frozen and pounded their heads to pulp upon the wheel lock.

Where there is not water there is fire filling the rusted oven of warped and twisting metal. It feasts on the sparse oxygen, yanking the very air from your lungs to burn it in front of you.

Again if you're lucky you catch fire and die in the brightness, with your own fat burning like candlewax. Otherwise the darkness of the seabed awaits...

This time I am in my cell, my bunk, my bed as the depth charge hits. I see the bulkhead metal twist and bend but not break, instead pressing in.

##### [As Warden Callum speaks, the perspective slowly shifts back to radio]

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio)_ Folding and squeezing, its rivets popping, my rivets popping, and no more air can reach me... 

#### GEORGIE

Anything?

##### [Sam picks up a gun from the rubble]

#### SAM

Found a gun? 

#### GEORGIE

Damn it! Where *is* he? 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio)_ And even as I breathe my last and fear floods my soul I know I cannot call for help. I spent all my pleas into a dead and silent radio. 

#### SAM

Where now? 

#### GEORGIE

I don't know! I don't recognize any of this! 

#### WARDEN CALLUM

_(from radio, weaker)_ It's just life, after all. It's all it can be. It feels like... this... for everyone...

##### [Silence.]

#### GEORGIE

Callum! Callum, no!

##### [More silence.]

#### SAM

What do we do? 

#### GEORGIE

I don't --

#### SAM

Georgie, I need you.

##### [She focuses up] 

#### GEORGIE

We keep hunting. Callum knew the risks and --

##### [She slaps a gun barrel away from her as Sam handles it poorly]

#### GEORGIE

God, have you ever even held a gun before? 

#### SAM

I did clay pigeon on a stag do once? 

#### GEORGIE

Right, well, rule one. Keep it pointing away from your mates. Rule two, you need to hold it properly.

##### [She adjusts his grip] 

#### GEORGIE

Tight to the shoulder, otherwise you'll break your arm. 

#### SAM

Better?

##### [She doesn't answer]

#### SAM

Georgie? 

#### GEORGIE

This isn't right. 

#### SAM

What do you -- Georgie, look out! 

#### GEORGIE

_(spinning)_ What?! 

#### SAM

Behind y-- wait... No, wait, it's gone. I was certain I saw... 

#### GEORGIE

That's what's wrong. Everything is getting mixed up. Old passages with new dead ends, new doors in old ruins. 

#### MELANIE

_(distant)_ Georgie! 

#### SAM

So is that really Melanie or...? 

#### GEORGIE

_(calling)_ Over here!

##### [Melanie and Basira approach] 

#### GEORGIE

Basira! I told you to watch the perimeter! 

#### BASIRA

I'm not one of your Wardens, you don't get to give me orders. Besides, Melanie needed an escort. 

#### GEORGIE

And what is Melanie doing out here? 

#### MELANIE

We've been trying to get you on the radio, but Callum has been jamming every frequency. 

#### GEORGIE

What's happened? 

#### MELANIE

It's that girl you brought in, Alice? She's gone. 

#### SAM

What do you mean gone? 

#### MELANIE

I mean she's gone. She wasn't a prisoner, so she just walked out while we were distracted. 

#### GEORGIE

Christ. 

#### MELANIE

It gets worse. I've been trying to correlate the positions people have been reporting... 

#### GEORGIE

And? 

#### MELANIE

They don't make any sense and no one else seems to realise. 

#### BASIRA

Nobody is where they think they are. Melanie is the only one who doesn't seem to be affected. I think it might be because... you know... 

#### MELANIE

You can say blind, Basira, it's not a rude word. Look, the point is that nobody can trust their eyes in here. I think the Archivist is using them. 

#### GEORGIE

Goddamn it. We're not prepped for this amount of bullshit.

_(into the radio)_ All wardens, mission aborted, fall back. I repeat, all wardens, we are falling back to base. Enemy is using visual manipulation so follow only known routes. And if you see a female civilian wearing a medical gown, call it in but do *not* approach.

##### [There is a chorus of "copy"s over the radio]

#### SAM

What about us? 

#### BASIRA

We follow Melanie. 

#### MELANIE

You're welcome.

##### [They start to move slowly, following the tapping of Melanie's cane]

#### SAM

So if the Archivist can control our eyes, does that mean he can see out of them? 

#### BASIRA

I really hope not. I'm not doing that Elias shit again. 

#### SAM

What? 

#### GEORGIE

Ignore her. Things are confused enough as it is. 

#### MELANIE

Shut your eyes if you're worried about it, Sam. It's not like they're helping. They continue, the tapping of the cane leading the way. There is an ominous cracking sound from below them. 

#### SAM

Um. You all *felt* that, right, because I have my eyes shut, so... 

#### MELANIE

Georgie I think we need to --

##### [They cry out as the ground gives way beneath them and they fall]

##### [Click.]

--- 

##### [Click]

##### [Sam and Melanie lie amongst the rubble of the collapsed roof. They both groan.]

#### SAM

_(pained)_ Melanie? 

#### MELANIE

Alive.

##### [She moves, but winces] 

#### MELANIE

Think my arm's broken, though. Can you move?

##### [Sam tries. It takes time as he is partially buried and the rocks are unsteady]

#### SAM

Yeah. I think I'm alright.

##### [He hisses in pain]

#### SAM

Mostly. What happened? 

#### MELANIE

We fell. London always had a warren underneath it, and after years without upkeep... 

#### SAM

You can fall through. 

#### MELANIE

Especially if the Zone is... agitated. 

#### SAM

Where are the others? 

#### MELANIE

Good question. 

#### SAM

_(shouting)_ Georgie!? Basira!? 

#### MELANIE

Don't! You don't know what else is listening. 

##### [Beat]

#### SAM

Sorry. 

#### MELANIE

Now if you're done trying to get the attention of every monster in the zone, I need your help.

##### [Sam goes over and examines Melanie]

#### SAM

_(digging)_ Okay, it doesn't look too bad, but it's going to need a sling. Bear with me. 

#### MELANIE

Thanks.

##### [Sam fashions a sling for Melanie as he talks]

#### SAM

Do you think you can still get us out of the Zone? 

#### MELANIE

I don't know. Above ground, maybe, but down here...

##### [An ominous breeze] 

#### MELANIE

...Do you feel that?

#### SAM

Yeah... 

#### MELANIE

Can you see anything? 

#### SAM

I don't --

##### [The Archivist manifests] 

#### SAM

_(hushed and afraid)_ It's here.

##### [The Archivist roils forward]

#### ARCHIVIST

Sam... 

#### SAM

Get away from me! 

#### MELANIE

John? John, is that you?

#### ARCHIVIST

...

_(tasting the word)_ John... No... Archivist... 

#### MELANIE

_(bravely)_ Archivist, answer me! Are you -- Were you once a man named Jonathan Sims? 

#### ARCHIVIST

_(slightly distastefully)_ Sims... Sims.

...

No. I am not... Sims. But I have his story. 

#### MELANIE

Huh. I guess I owe Georgie a drink.

##### [The Archivist looms] 

#### SAM

So if you're not Jonathan Sims, then who are you? 

#### ARCHIVIST

_(almost laughing)_ Who am I? I am the one who asks Sam... Who are *you?*

##### [Sam starts resisting]

#### MELANIE

Sam! 

#### ARCHIVIST

_(compelling)_ *Speak.* 

#### SAM

_(resisting)_ When I was five years old... my mother took me to a zoo... I don't remember the name of it, and afterwards she wouldn't tell me. It smelt wrong --

##### [Footsteps charge in from a nearby tunnel] 

#### ALICE

Get away from him!

##### [She tackles the Archivist hard]

##### [Sam is released and he falls, panting] 

#### SAM

Alice! No!

##### [Sounds of struggle]

#### BASIRA

_(distant)_ This way! I hear something! 

#### MELANIE

_(calling)_ Here! We're over here! 

#### GEORGIE

_(distant)_ Melanie!

##### [Sounds of struggle end -- the Archivist has caught Alice]

#### ARCHIVIST

_(to Alice)_ Alice... 

#### ALICE

_(overpowered)_ Maybe... Who's asking? 

#### ARCHIVIST

_(examining her)_ Your story. It is told and tired. 

#### ALICE

Sorry to disappoint... 

#### SAM

_(helpless)_ Alice... 

#### ALICE

Sam. I love --

##### [The Archivist breaks Alice with disdain, dropping her corpse to the ground.]

#### SAM

No! 

#### GEORGIE

_(closer)_ This way, come on!

##### [The Archivist wheels about, considers, then begins to fade]

#### ARCHIVIST

Lucky Sam... Lucky, lucky, lucky...

##### [The ominous wind blows and with it, the Archivist disappears]

#### BASIRA

_(closer)_ I found them! 

#### SAM

Alice...

##### [Click.]

---

##### [Click]

##### [We're back at headquarters, in the medical ward]

##### [Melanie cries out as Georgie fixes her arm]

#### GEORGIE

And... There we go. 

#### MELANIE

I *hate* this medical shit. 

#### GEORGIE

Most people would kill to have access to all this "medical shit." You're lucky it was only dislocated. It could have been a lot worse. 

#### SAM

_(hollow)_ It was.

##### [Pause]

#### BASIRA

I'm sorry. If we'd found you earlier... 

#### SAM

It wouldn't have made a difference. If Alice hadn't -- Then I'd be the one in the morgue right now. 

...I know she wasn't *my* Alice. But she was still Alice. And I -- There was nothing -- She didn't deserve that. 

#### BASIRA

No one ever does.

##### [Silence.] 

#### GEORGIE

Listen, I know we're hurting. I know we just want to call it a day and lick our wounds. But we still need to figure out what we're going to do about the Archivist. 

#### BASIRA

Georgie --

#### SAM

No. She's right.

#### GEORGIE

...

You're sure it wasn't him, Melanie? 

#### MELANIE

Positive. It actively denied it, and besides, that voice... it's not him. 

#### GEORGIE

Right, well, I'll take that as a win for now, but we still don't have a way to track it or kill it and with all these new powers in the zone... we're going to struggle. 

#### MELANIE

Yeah. 

#### BASIRA

That's not our only problem. 

#### GEORGIE

More bad news? 

#### BASIRA

I noticed something as we were coming out. I didn't trust my eyes, so I had a couple of wardens confirm it later. 

#### MELANIE

What? 

#### BASIRA

You know that slight warping effect at the edge of the zone? 

#### GEORGIE

The shimmer, yeah, what about it? 

#### BASIRA

It's moved. 

#### GEORGIE

What do you mean it's moved --

#### BASIRA

It's at least a meter beyond the fencing already.

##### [They digest this] 

#### SAM

It's the Archivist. It has to be. 

#### BASIRA

Yeah. I think the zone has been growing since it arrived and now...

#### GEORGIE

Oh, fuck.

##### [Click.]
