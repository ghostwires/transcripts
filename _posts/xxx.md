Hello and welcome to the holiday special of the *Rusty Quill Gaming* podcast! I am your host and GM Alex Newall and with me today I have:

#### HELEN

Helen Gould!

#### BRYN

Bryn Monroe,

#### BEN

Ben Meredith.

#### ALEX

Unfortunately Lydia can't be with us here today. Presumably she's off helping a guy in a big red suit and other denominational deities -- does, is Santa a deity? I don't know.

#### HELEN

...Nnno. _(laughs)_

#### BRYN

_(overlapping)_ He is a saint.

#### ALEX

Is he a saint? He is, yes.

#### BEN

Saint Nicholas.

#### HELEN

Oh, yeah! I knew Santa is from, like, the Spanish-y sounding languages, maybe.

#### ALEX

Oh, there we go, then. So -- _(struggles)_ ish?

#### BRYN

I'm going to go with "ish."

#### BEN

_(overlapping)_ He punched a pope in the face, I think.

#### HELEN

*Really!*

##### [Bryn cackles]

#### ALEX

_(laughing)_ Okay, I'm abandoning the start of this episode. Do share.

#### BEN

Oh, I -- I think -- and this is like, I've got very rough history, but basically I think they had one of the counselors, like the counselor of Nicea and Saint Nicholas was there, and they were having an argument over the Arian heresy? Which isn't the Nazi "Aryan," and it's -- yeah. A guy called Arial Something. They got into a fistfight about theology and he punched him right in the face, and I think the person he punched went on to become pope, so Santa Claus punched the pope in the face.

#### ALEX

_(overlapping)_ I CURSE YOU TO DELIVER PRESENTS FOR ETERNITY! For punching the pope. I've decided that's canon.

#### HELEN

Okay. We've all been there.

#### BEN

_(kindly)_ Alex, the Catholic Church aren't actually magic.

##### [Laughter]

I hate to break it to you --

#### ALEX

I'm fairly certain that's where paladins came from, Ben. Right. Anyway, today we are going to be playing, you know, just to shake things up for our third party things, a game by Grant Howitt! _(sarcastically)_ Hold the phone!

#### BRYN

_(playing along)_ Grant Howitt?

#### ALEX

I know!

#### BEN

*Never* heard of him.

#### ALEX

So we've never really mentioned him before. He's a game designer, I think we've had him on as a guest, possibly. They all blend together.

#### BEN

_(holding back laughter)_ All the different Grants.

##### [Helen cackles]

#### ALEX

All the different Grants that we've had! But we are going to be doing Honey Heist. Honey Heist is a game which is --

#### BRYN

Didn't Critical Role play that?

#### BEN

I was going to say, "you know, that one that podcast that's much more popular than this one."

#### ALEX

Oh, there you go, there you go.

#### BRYN

"Much more successful..."

#### BEN

"With the voice actors!"

#### BRYN

Yeah.

#### ALEX

It's Honey Con, 2018. You are going to undertake the greatest heist the world has ever seen. Two things! One, you have a complex plan that requires precise timing. Two, you are a god damn bear.

So, I'm going to go around and we're going to be *rolling* for characters, no pre-genning here. Who'd like to go first?

#### BRYN

Oh, if I don't get to play a polar bear --

#### ALEX

_(overlapping)_ Who's going first?

#### BRYN

-- I'm going to cry.

#### BEN

I'll go first. So I can steal polar bear out from under Bryn.

#### ALEX

Go for it.

#### BEN

Right. My descriptor is...

##### [DICE ROLLS]

I am "washed-up."

#### HELEN

Ooh.

#### BEN

I am a washed-up...

##### [DICE ROLLS]

Aww! I missed it -- I am a washed-up panda.

##### [Bryn cackles]

#### BEN

My role is...

##### [DICE ROLLS]

I am the face. So I am a washed-up panda face. And, are we rolling for hats?

#### ALEX

Of course you're rolling for hats! What do you think we are, philistines?

#### BEN

Give me a D8, cos this is apparently an aberration to the system.

#### HELEN

Ooh.

##### [Dice rolls]

#### BEN

Wearing a... cowboy hat.

#### ALEX

Aw, yeah!

#### HELEN

Oh, fantastic.

#### BEN

I am a washed-up panda face wearing a cowboy hat. I would like to think that I am also -- have a cigar, because of that guy from the eighties.

#### ALEX



#### BRYN

I assumed when I read "roll 3D6" that you roll them all *simultaneously* and got to then assign a die to each of the categories.

#### BEN

I like to live by the number.

#### ALEX

We're going to go one at a time --

#### BRYN

Okay.
