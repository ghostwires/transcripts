Virgin and Child Tapestry- 2011
Material: Egyptian Cotton, Silk, Gold
Bidding Starts: $2500
A classic Cutler style piece, depicting the Virgin Mary and the child
Christ. Fine gold embroidery encircles the heads of the holy figures, set upon a
field of azure silk. The cotton that makes up the subjects is comparatively
matte, lending an air of humanity to the pair. Though the surrounding color
complements their pale skin and blonde hair, they seem out of place against

the luster, a mix of human and divine, both and neither at once. The thinness
of the fabric makes it seem almost as if the two are breathing.
This piece may have been Cutler’s favorite. He toured it widely at art
galleries, but refused to sell it for fear that the buyer would not truly
appreciate his mastery. The high price reflects the desire for a keen and
knowledgeable buyer. While Cutler and his contributions to the world of highend weaving will be missed, we at his estate are dedicated to ensuring that
each piece not sold in life finds its proper place now that he has gone to rest.

Ravenstail “Opened Box of Daylight” Hanging- 2016
Material: Merino Wool, Qiviut
Bidding Starts: $500
Unlike traditional Tlingit “Box of Daylight” designs, Cutler’s inspired work
reimagines the simple geometry of concentric rectangles to show the lids of
the “boxes” propped open. Qiviut provides a unique bordering around white
merino. A thin line of qiviut, hand-dyed a deep, sunset red, waits in the center
of the smallest box. Though its black wool containers are open, it hesitates,
stuck in a moment of darkness before it joins the surrounding tapestry.
The choice of technique is unusual for Cutler, though can be understood
in the context of the cultural exploration, as it were, of his later years. The

hanging did earn Cutler criticism given his lack of connection with the culture,
as well as how much he stood to profit from his work. He replied with
signature wit, arguing that his critics were hypocrites who couldn’t “buy so
much as a potholder off me”.
The intent of the piece was certainly to honor both the art form and
culture. However, this criticism, and backlash from his response, may have
contributed to Cutler’s difficulty in selling the piece. After a few gallery
showings, he retired the piece soon before himself retiring from the public eye
to work on what he termed “self-based projects”.

Geometric Rug- 2019
Material: Carpet Wool
Bidding Starts: $800
A prime example of Cutler’s later works. Harsh lines frame four
diamonds of red, black, and gray, patterned like a bloodshot eye. Black lines
break into ever-smaller repetitions to connect the framing lines and everwatching eyes. Though the fineness of the thread would allow for the sloping
shapes Cutler tended to prefer, the design remains resolutely geometric. Its
symmetry and repetition become dizzying, like a fractal viewed too long.

While Cutler experimented number of cultures in his career, it is difficult
to place this piece geographically. To the untrained eye, it may resemble the
weavings of the American Southwest, but its symmetry is radial, not bilateral.
Perhaps its resemblance to certain central Asian styles is intentional, or
perhaps it is entirely of Cutler’s own making.
The motivation of this piece is likewise unclear. Cutler himself never
showed it, as it came some two years after he was last seen outside his
Vermont home. Instead, a member of the family was the one to bring it to an
artist’s market, along with several smaller pieces of Cutler’s. The other items
sold quickly, but the rug was ignored, even as the seller began offering it for
free. The family member explained that she “just wanted to get it away from
him,” but refused to elaborate as to why. Whether she returned this piece to
him despite her comments or if he reproduced it later on is uncertain.
Regardless of its meaning or purpose, the rug remains entrancing. Its
countless branches draw the viewer to those eyes again and again. Feverish
desire for an end builds as the viewer traces the same paths, but relief never
arrives. It is a sense that you, like Cutler, are on the verge of a breakthrough.

The Missing Piece, Art Tapestry- Date Unknown
Material: Silk, Material Unknown

Rusty Fears 5 – Final Sale of the Remaining Works of E. Cutler

Bidding Starts: $1300
A brilliant art piece, showing an almost humanoid form torn roughly
from what appears to be a mandala design, as divorced from culture and origin
as the rug previously auctioned. Ribbons of silk drape in the empty space left
by the figure, occasionally moving in an unfelt draft like the limbs of a spider
that does not quite know it has died. The symmetry of the mandala is
destroyed by the missing space, the form of which implies the figure has
stepped out, one arm outstretched. A kaleidoscope of thread slouches and
unravels without the support of the weave. Dripping from the frayed edges is a
viscous, black substance that at first glance appears to be paint. However, it
remains moist, not tacky. Its purpose may be found in the symbolism of the
piece, or what can be determined without Cutler’s insight.
The choice of imagery is striking here. Though the mandala is not strictly
Buddhist, at the beginning the design does seems reminiscent of tantric
mandalas. As the piece continues and the figure splits from the weave, the
pattern grows more angular and fractures into lines so small some are a mere
thread thick. Still, it can be understood to be a mandala of some type. An odd
choice, as while Cutler was no stranger to religious imagery, he himself was not
religious. Of course, nor was Cutler a stranger to dabbling in things he did not
understand.

Without a clear culture or style to attribute it to, we are forced to make
overarching assumptions as to the meaning of the piece. If the mandala is to
represent wholeness, the symbolism of removing a piece is clear. If, however,
it is to represent the self, as many cultures attributed to it, then what of the
thing torn from it? Is it a fragment of himself, a part so hated that he himself
sought to destroy it as it broke free? Or is it its own self, something Cutler
maligned despite his role in its creation?
Many questions arise from this piece, but let us keep to answers. Our
focus is the substance that anoints the ragged edges. It is opaque in places and
merely pigments areas over which it is smeared. Its consistency is like that of
blood, though unlike blood it does not dry. Perhaps the fluid is representative
of such, the exit unwilling, the outstretched hand not offered, but torn, and
the remaining tapestry a gaping wound that refuses to heal.
Yet there is no evidence of the figure. A successful escape, but not one
without cost.

Portrait of a Man(?)- Date Unknown

A return to Cutler classic. While not as vibrant as the “Virgin and Child”
piece, exquisite detailing can be made out on closer inspection. The figure
stands left-of-center, partially obscured by a door that is richly embroidered in
imitation of swirling carvings. Like the “Virgin and Child”, the figure is framed in
light, but here it is muted, as if coming from some distance. Perhaps due to this
backlighting, the subject is cast entirely in black silk apart from its eyes, which
gleam from the stygian surroundings with pearl-like iridescence. No pupil has
been added, either in the weave or embroidered afterwards. In fact, the figure
is entirely without detail. It seems out of place against the matte cotton
background, a “Virgin and Child” in reverse.
The simplicity of the figure renders it impossible to identify. The door
can be recognized as the antique oak door to Cutler’s weaving room, but there
is no evidence of anyone visiting Cutler in the months leading up to his death.
Both the front and back doors remained locked up to the time of Cutler’s
death, which was only detected by neighbors after the stench of rotting meat
began emanating from the house. If the figure is to represent anyone at all, it
must either be from memory or someone who had been in the house with him
at the time. Given the ruling of his death as a suicide, it is possible that Cutler’s
mental state had deteriorated to such a point that the thing is an expression of
a hallucination.

This theory is not without evidence within the piece. As it continues, the
initially certain weave becomes more and more disordered, until at the bottom
dropped strands hang like prisoners at the gallows. The light of the doorway
combines with its frame. The shaded and embroidered door dissolves into a
mass of unintelligible colors, embroidery floss shoved roughly through in parts
as if to parody the details above. The only thing that remains consistent
throughout the piece is the figure.
Unlike most of Cutler’s tapestries, the figure’s form is indefinite. Strands
of black continue well past its apparent boundaries, sometimes woven in with
silk and sometimes applied afterwards in what appears to be the same
substance as on “The Missing Piece”. Its purpose in the tapestry is again
unclear, though it is spread in the shape of a spindling hand near the figure’s
face, as if to suggest a loving touch.

Fabric Shears- Date Unknown
Material: Stainless-steel, Blood, Substance Unknown
Bidding Starts: $75
A pair of stainless-steel fabric shears, used to make clean cuts through
even the most reluctant matter. Uncharacteristic of Cutler, these are
unadorned, their utility rendering them invisible. Viscous black circles the
8

Rusty Fears 5 – Final Sale of the Remaining Works of E. Cutler

handle and oozes between the hinge, too large for a hand yet distinguished
into trailing fingers in a mockery of human anatomy. A crust of dried blood
coats the blades and renders them unusable. The source can be deduced given
the state of Cutler’s body. Thirteen wounds may seem excessive to us, but for
someone like Cutler it can only be the destructive answer to his creative fervor
in life.
Let the bidding begin.
