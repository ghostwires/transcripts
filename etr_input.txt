1. INT. OIAR MAIN OFFICE - NIGHT, RAINING (COMPUTER).
A decrepit computer turns on in a dated and dingy shared
office in Royal Mint Court. There is the hum and whine of
an old PC - the sort of mid-90s oversized, slightly
yellowing plastic tower that still has a floppy disk drive.
A tinny digital fanfare accompanies its awakening, then the
PC settles into the quiet whirr of its fan.
There is a slight stutter of digital distortion and then
the computer's aged microphone abruptly begins recording.
It is eavesdropping on an anemic work party. SAM, LENA and
GWEN can be heard quietly talking in another part of the
office.
ALICE
[What are you] -looking forward to
the most?
TEDDY
I mean, occasionally seeing the
sun could be nice?
ALICE
Boooo! Your pathetic addiction to
vitamin D will only make you weak.
TEDDY
But Alice, my bones! They’re ready
to snap like twiglets!
ALICE
Listen to me: bones are a lie
peddled by Big Milk to keep you
buying. No such thing.
TEDDY
Right, so what keeps your body
upright?
ALICE
(grinning)
Spite and coffee.

TEDDY
(laughing) Well, I’m afraid we
can’t all subsist entirely on
coffee and social media drama.
ALICE
Not with that attitude. I reckon
you could crack it in another 4
years…
TEDDY
Another 4 years of you and cracked
is exactly what I’d be!
Small laugh.
Beat.
ALICE
I'm gonna miss you Teddy.
TEDDY
Nah, we'll stay in touch, right?
ALICE
(unconvincingly)
‘course. I mean, yeah, if you
think you can escape my iconic
brand of nonsense by getting a
boring, normal job you're going to
be sadly disappointed, my friend.
TEDDY
You know most people would
consider civil service a boring,
normal job.
ALICE
Yeah, well, most people don’t work
here.
COLIN
(approaching)
Ain’t that the truth.
COLIN shuffles up, a touch worse for drink.

ALICE
Colin! There’s my guy! How's it
hanging? Is it an app yet? Do we
have a minimalist logo? I assume
you’ve finished all the social
features?
COLIN
Don't you start. I swear I'm going
to shove a cable down that prick's
throat, pull it out his
ministerial anus and floss him to
death.
ALICE
Is that what you mean when you go
on about things being “backwards
compatible”?
Colin sighs wearily.
Booo!

TEDDY

ALICE
Don’t boo me! I created you, and I
can destroy you!
Laughter.
COLIN
So are we just leaving Sam to the
wolves then?
ALICE
He's a big boy, he can look after
himself. Besides, he's going to be
working with them.
COLIN
Sure but you know how Gwen and
Lena can be…
TEDDY
- awful?

[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

COLIN
(overlapping)
-intense.
ALICE
He’s fine. ‘Course it wouldn’t
have been an issue if we’d just
done this at the pub like normal…
TEDDY
You know Lena.
(imitating)
"Proper procedure requires any
provided food and beverages to be
consumed on site. This includes
cake.”. Fair play, though, Sam's
been a good sport. God knows you
wouldn’t have got me to a
stranger’s goodbye party at six in
the morning.
ALICE
(moving away)
Eurgh. Fine, I'll go rescue him.
Beat.
COLIN
So... Insurance?
TEDDY
It’s reliable.
COLIN
True. Just let me know if they
need an IT guy, yeah?
TEDDY
Colin, mate, you know you’re never
getting out of here.
COLIN
Christ, don’t say that.

[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

TEDDY
Even if his nibs lets you off the
hook, which he won’t, you couldn’t
bring yourself to just leave. Not
'til you’ve figured out all these
fun little errors.
COLIN
Or they finally kill me.
TEDDY
I mean, sure, that too.
Beat.
TEDDY
Heads up, looks like they're all
coming over.
COLIN
(morose)
Great.
ALICE, SAM, LENA and GWEN come over.
Hey!

TEDDY

LENA
Enjoying the party?
TEDDY
Colin was just saying how much of
a blast he’s having, isn’t that
right?
LENA
(sardonic)
Oh really.
Uh, sure.

COLIN

TEDDY
-and how he’d love to take the
afterparty to the pub.

ALICE

What a great idea, Colin.
LENA
Nonsense. Sam is the only one who
has had any cake so far.
GWEN
And that was only because you
practically forced it down his
throat.
SAM
No, no, it was... nice.
LENA
People like chocolate cake.
GWEN
(sullen)
People like being treated like
adults…
Beat. Gwen may have overstepped there.
LENA
Thank you for you feedback, Gwen.
I will take it under advisement.
Now I was just telling Sam that he
can expect supportive co-workers
here at the O.I.A.R..
ALICE
Oh Yeah. We’re a real family. I#m
your cool sister, Gwen’s your
uncool sister, Lena’s you
emotionally distant mother, Teddys
the uncle that just got another
job, and Colin’s the family’s
grumpy IT manager
GWEN
You'll have to forgive Alice, Sam.
She's convinced that she's funny.

[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
It's alright, we actually go way
back.
LENA
Alice recommended Sam for the job.
GWEN
Oh? Nepotism, is it?
ALICE
(acidly)
I learned from the best.
GWEN
People are trying to enjoy
themselves, Alice. Could you
please just turn it off for a
moment?
TEDDY
(gently steering)
Soooo! I think we might all be
done on cake, so I'm going to call
it and suggest anyone who wants to
can decamp to the pub, ok?
Plan.

COLIN

LENA
If that’s the consensus, I will
accept it. Although I’m afraid I
won’t be able to join you at The
StewardShame...

ALICE

LENA
-but do take Sam along and enjoy
yourselves. Just remember it is a
work night.
SAM
Oh, er, sure. I'm down.

[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Great!

Private & Confidential
TEDDY

LENA
Oh, and Teddy?
Mm?

TEDDY

LENA
I understand you're leaving us,
but that's no excuse for being
sloppy. Please ensure you shut
down your workstation before you
depart.
TEDDY
Hm? Oh I already d- Oh. That'suh... Right, hang on, I'll justTeddy pushes the power button. The recording ends and the
internal fans spin down as the computer is shut down.
2. INT. OIAR MAIN OFFICE - NIGHT, RAINING – (COMPUTER).
The computer boots up and the microphone switches on. Sam
is sat at his desk, filling out paperwork. ALICE
approaches.
ALICE
Right then. Ready?
SAM
Hang on, I've still got the last
page to fill in. Do I really have
to put "Samama Khalid" at the top
of every single page?
ALICE
Yeah, they're pretty big on
paperwork around here.
SAM
There has to be a way to do this
online.
Beat.

[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

What?

Private & Confidential
SAM CONT.

ALICE
(chuckling)
You'll see. Anyway, hurry it up,
time to mold you like clay into
the perfect government drone for
the Office of Incident Assessment
and Response.
SAM
Speaking of, there's this box for
a "Response 121" on the form. Do
you know what that is?
ALICE
Oh, you can ignore that. There
used to be a separate "Response"
department, I think, but now it's
just us. Guess they never updated
the onboarding.
SAM
Ah. I already ticked it - is that
a problem?
ALICE
I doubt it since no one actually
reads that stuff.
Beat.
ALICE (CONT.)
Right pens down, eyes front, class
is in session.
Right.

SAM

Sam puts the paperwork away on the desk.
SAM CONT.
Lead on, sensei.

[10]

ALICE
So, this cutting-edge device is
known as a personal computer, or
"PC" for shortSAM
Alice, I know you're joking, but
how old is this thing? It has a
floppy drive.
ALICE
Patience young one. You've got
your login details from Colin,
right?
SAM
Sure.
ALICE
(faux portentous)
Then bestow them unto the device
that you may gain its ancient
wisdom…
SAM
Right.
Sam types in his login. There's a beep and the computer
starts to spin up with very retro fanfare.
SAM
What-?
ALICE
(sweetly)
Something wrong sweetie?
SAM
Is this… Windows 95?
ALICE
Of course not - don't be
ridiculous!
Beat.

[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ALICE
(cont.)
This is a modified version of
Windows NT 4.0, the businessfocused predecessor to 95.
SAM
H-How is that even-? There’s no
way this is still supported...
ALICE
I think a good half of Colin's job
is just making sure the
workstations don't all try to
update and instantly brick
themselves.
SAM
But... I mean, why?
ALICE
See that symbol?
Alice double clicks something on the screen.
SAM
(reading)
FR3-d1?
ALICE
Meet Freddy. The program doesn't
really have a proper name. Bespoke
software from the mid-nineties, I
think. It's the bedrock that the
whole system is based on, and it’s
been at least fifteen years since
anyone actually knew how it
worked.
SAM
What does it do?
ALICE
Crashes, mostly. At least it does
if you try to update it, breath
too loudly or link it to anything
developed more recently than the
Bronze Age collapse.
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
So what's it supposed to do, then?
ALICE
It searches online databases,
newspapers, forums or whatever for
incidents, flags them, then passes
them through to us for assessment.
SAM
What sort of "incidents"?
Beat.
ALICE
(slightly hesitant)
You'll see.
SAM
Right, so this list is...
ALICE
Today’s case files. Just double
click on the top one.
Sam double-clicks.
ALICE
Ok, so looks like it's an email.
SAM
And I just... read it? Is that
even legal?
ALICE
Probably. We do work for the
government. Sort of.
SAM
What about GDPR?
ALICE
Look, Sam, I don't know what to
tell you. This is the job. I've
been doing it for years and
there's never been any problems.
Maybe ask Lena? - She’d probably
know.
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
Fine. Sorry. Ok, so...
He starts reading. Pause.
This is-

SAM

ALICE
Yeah, they're all like that. At
least this one is short, nice easy
start for you. So, once you've
read it, you get out the binderShe slaps an enormous ring binder on the desk and starts
paging through it as she speaks.
ALICE CONT.
And look up whatever’s mentioned
most in the case. Looking at this
one we go to “D” and… Sam, eyes on
me now. We go to “D” and, right,
would you say this is more "Dolls
comma watching" or "Dolls comma
human skin".
SAM
(a bit shell-shocked)
IUh- I mean- I guess the human
skin bit is only implied, so...
both?
ALICE
Nah you can only pick one,
Freddy's dumb as rocks. Right, so,
after each entry there's four
numbers. That’s the DPHW. So,
“dolls comma watching” is... 1157.
Then you cross reference with the
table here, that would be a 2-C,
and then you type that into the
box here, along with date of
incident if there is one and
today’s date. Which gives us…
Alice’s quickly types.

[14]

Private & Confidential

ALICE CONT.
CAT2RC1157- 12052022-13012024 and
then we hit submit.
Beat.
ALICE CONT.
Well go on then.
SAM
Oh, right!
Sam double clicks. There's an 8-bit chime.
ALICE
Excellent work. We’ll make a wage
slave of you yet.
SAM
Where does it go?
ALICE
If I were a betting woman, I'd say
some long dead database that noone will ever look at or care
about.
SAM
So why do it?
ALICE
Because that's what they're paying
us to do.
SAM makes an incredulous noise.
ALICE
Welcome to civil service.
SAM
What the hell sort of job have you
gotten me Alice?
ALICE
One where you get paid to hang out
with the coolest person left in
London all night, every night.
You’re welcome.
[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM laughs despite himself.
ALICE
Now you try the next one.
SAM
Right, so...
He double-clicks the next case. NORRIS's voice blares from
the speakers abruptly. They both talk over his monologue.

Hey! You got Norris!
SAM

What?

ALICE
(talking over)
It's... Hang on, you can pause it
by hitting space.
She hits spacebar and NORRIS abruptly stops speaking.

ALICE
Sorry, didn't think you’d get one
of those so soon.

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
One of what? Why is it reading it
out?
ALICE
Started about a year ago. Best
Colin can figure, something
brokeand whichever genius made the
program ran some redundancy
through the sound card.
SAM
Right…
ALICE
Yeah.
Lena won’t authorize Colin’s
proposed solution: Smashing it
with a hammer. All it really means
to you is that it’ll read out
maybe one in twenty cases and
won’t let you do the next one
until it finishes.
SAM
But- No hang on, that doesn't make
any sense. If Freddy's a search
program from the nineties, why
would it have text-to-speech?
ALICE
Great question. I asked Colin the
same thing a while back.
SAM
And what did he say?
ALICE
Nothing. He just snapped a pencil
in half and walked away.. Look
Sam, it’s a completely knackered
system that’s old as balls.
Dangly, grey-haired old man balls.
And until it finally collapses
forever, we just have to put up
and shut up.
[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
So how do we stop it reading them
out?
ALICE
No idea. So now, when we come
across a chatty case, we generally
take that as a cue to get coffee.
Then we come back and read it
through once the computer's done
waffling.
SAM
Right. Okay. And who's

Norris?

ALICE
So, there are three voices it
reads them in. I call them Norris,
Chester and Augustus, although
Gwen doesn't like it. This one
here is Neil, he and Chester are
the most common.
SAM
But it’s okay if I do hear it?
Like, I’m just thinking I can
finish up this onboarding here
while it’s running.
ALICE
Knock yourself out. Just grab me
in the break room when it's done.
We’ve got a load more to get
through.

Gotcha.

SAM

Sam hits spacebar again.

From: Harriet Winstead
(hpw332@mailpod.com)
Date: May 12 2022.
Subject: Re: Re: checking in
I’m so sorry. I should have
listened. I just couldn’t face the
thought of the rest of my life
never hearing him again, I had to
try. It wasn’t a scam, not like
you said.
He sounded different when he
called. He was all eager with an
off-putting sort of excitement,
not like our earlier face-to-face
consultations. He just gave me an
address and told me to be there
that night:: Grantham Cemetery. I
started to wonder if this was all
just another messed-up sales
pitch. Some preachy lesson about
acceptance and letting go before
asking for more cash. But I had to
know, so I went to the cemetery.
I used to love the night. When
Arthur couldn’t sleep we would
just walk for hours under the
lampposts, just us and the
occasional headlights streaking
past. It frightens me now. I look
at the shadows, not the lights.
They hide whatever it was that
took him away from me.
The cemetery gates were wide open.
I don’t know if I would have had
it in me to break in. I was so
nervous that the smallest obstacle
might have sent me running home.
But they were open. So in I went.
Slowly, towards the grave.

[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

It’s not a big graveyard, and
spacious enough that I could see
the figure standing there before I
got too close. For a moment my
heart skipped and I thought it
might be Arthur but no, the shape…
The shape was all wrong. Then my
step faltered, because I had no
idea who else it could be. They
were too short for the consultant.
Maybe someone else entirely, some
innocent mourner? In the middle of
the night? I doubted it.
I was scared, Darla. I was so
scared. I was certain I’d been set
up, that I was going to be
grabbed. I turned to leave, hoping
I could get back to the main road
lights but then the figure began
to speak from where it was stooped
in the dark.
It was

called my name and I know
his voice. I froze in

It came closer, and as the moon
escaped the clouds for a moment I
could make out the discolored
skin, the mismatched features. It
moved slowly, shuddering towards
me with a jerky, ungainly step.
Something was pressed against its
skin, from the inside.
I said the only thing I could
think:
“Arthur? Is that you?”
And that voice I have loved for
twenty years answered: “Some of
him.”

[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

And then it laughed. Great heaving
gasps and wheezes that seemed to
leak out as if through a rotten
bellows. It laughed and laughed,
violently throwing its head back
and forth, faster and faster,
impossibly fast. So fast I could
hear bones snapping.
I ran, and it didn’t chase me.
I don’t know what to do now. I’ve
not left the house all day. I keep
thinking I see something at the
bottom of the garden, but I can’t
bring myself to check. Do I call
the police? What could I even tell
them? I tried calling the helpline
but no one answers. Are you free
tonight? I don’t want to stay at
the house. I know you warned me
that it was too full of memories
but this isn’t that. I’m afraid
Darla and worse, I think it's
Arthur I’m afraid of. Or what’s
left of him. Please get back to me
a.s.a.p.

4. INT.

OIAR main office - NIGHT, RAINING – (COMPUTER).

Sam is sitting there, slightly freaked out by what he's
just heard. He exhales slowly. Alice comes up behind him
and he jumps as she speaks.
ALICE
You didn’t come get me?
SAM
I... Yeah, sorry. I got
distracted. Are they all like
that?

[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ALICE
What? Upsetting and horrible?
Yeah, pretty much. That one seemed
pretty tame, to be honest.
SAM
Great. Can’t wait for a bad one.
ALICE
So, ready to score it?
SAM
Sure, so, uh...
He starts leafing through the massive binder.
SAM
“Zombies” would probably be under
Z, right?
ALICE
Yeah, it’s mostly alphabetical.
Gwen, who has overheard this, calls over from her desk.
GWEN
(calling)
It’s not zombies.
ALICE
I’m sorry, Gwen, I thought Sam was
shadowing me today since you’re so
busy with your own massive
backlog.
GWEN
(Standing and coming
over)
And you’re just going to let him
put “zombies”? He’ll get a misfile
on his first case.
ALICE
No he won’t.
(To Sam)
You basically never get a misfile.
No-one’s checking this stuffGwen starts leafing through his binder.
[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

GWEN
Here. “Reanimation”. I’d probably
go with “partial” cross linked
with “regret”, but you could also
go with "amalgamative" subsection
“semi”.
ALICE
Zombies would have been fine.
GWEN
A) no it wouldn’t and B) there's
at least three pages of subclassifications for Zombies. He’d
be here for hours.
ALICE
And I’m guessing this dedication
to detail is why you're so behind?
GWEN
It's why I have the highest
accuracy rate in the office.
ALICE
Which, and it’s absolutely crucial
you understand this Sam, means
exactly nothing.
SAM
I’m going to put “reanimation”,
ok?
ALICE
Fine, whatever. Like I say, none
of it matters, so arguing about it
is a waste of everybody’s time.
And none of us have much of that
going spare tonight do we Gwen?
GWEN
Just making sure he’s taught
properly. If you want to be
picking up after him for the whole
year, be my guest.
ALICE
Gwen?

What?

ALICE
Lena wants you in her office.
Gwen looks over.
GWEN
Oh joy. Just want I need tonight.
She stands and starts heading off.
GWEN CONT.

Don’t let her teach you too many
bad habits Sam.
SAM
(chuckling)
I’ll do my best.
ALICE
(good-natured)
Traitor…
5. INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE- NIGHT, RAINING – (MANAGER’S
SPEAKERPHONE)
Lena’s office is pristine, sterile and has nothing that
might indicate its occupant would be brash enough to have a
personality. GWEN enters.
GWEN
You wanted to see me?
LENA
Yes, Gwen. Please sit down.
GWEN does so. It is clear from her tone she knows what to
expect and has been here several times before.
GWEN
Another “performance review”? Can
we make it a bit quicker this
time?
[24]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

LENA
You’re aware you are significantly
behind your caseload?
GWEN
Because I’m actually trying to
process them correctly. You can
have it right or you can have it
fast.
LENA
Regardless, that’s not what I
wanted to talk to you about.
GWEN
I see. So what else have I done
wrong, then?
LENA
Last night. At Teddy’s leaving
party“Party”

GWEN

Beat. The room gets a little colder.
LENA
Last night at Teddy’s leaving
event you were openly
disrespectful towards me in front
of the new hire. This is not
acceptable.
GWEN
Seriously? You’re calling me in
here because I backtalked you in
front of the new guy?
LENA
I’m well aware you dislike me,
Gwen, and that’s entirely your
prerogative but I am still your
manager and undercutting my
authority in front of a new team
member is deeply inappropriate.

[25]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

GWEN
(Standing)
Understood. Now if that’s allLENA
It’s not. Sit down.
Gwen sighs and sits.
LENA CONT.
If you hate working here so
completely, you are perfectly
within your rights to resign. No
one is forcing you to stay here.
GWEN
You’d like that, wouldn’t you?
LENA
Honestly, it more or less balances
out. You are difficult to manage,
but hiring new staff is always
something of a pain.
Beat.
LENA CONT.
What do you actually want, Gwen?
Your job.

GWEN

Beat.
LENA
You think you could do it better?
GWEN
I do.
LENA
Hmmm. I’ve always known you
thought you were slumming it down
here, but I never actually
considered you might think of this
as the first step of a career.
Most people simply move on within
12 months or so.
[26]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

GWEN
I’m not most people.
There is a pause as LENA considers this.
No.

LENA
GWEN

No?
LENA
No. Unfortunately, I know what
climbing this particular ladder
entails, and you don’t have what
it takes.
GWEN
Surprise, surprise.
LENA
I’m sorry to put it so bluntly,
but I really do fear your ambition
is misplaced here.
GWEN
(leaving)
Mmhm. Well, good talk as always.
Excellent use of my time. Let me
know if you have any other gems of
wisdom you want to spit in my
face.
LENA
Gwen, that’s- [exactly the kind of
attitude…]
Gwen is already out the door and slams it behind her.
LENA sighs.
6. INT. OIAR BREAK ROOM- NIGHT, RAINING – (CCTV).
COLIN is sat in the corner, grimly drinking a cup of tea.
SAM enters and heads over to the coffee machine.

COLIN grunts an affirmative.
SAM
Hey.
COLIN grunts.
Beat. SAM starts to make his coffee
SAM
So. How’s the app going?
COLIN
(Immediately furious)
So that’s it, is it? Lena’s hired
another smart-mouthed prick to
just piss around and cause
problems?
SAM
Wow, okayCOLIN
I already have to explain to some
chinless inbred politician that
we’re running on something as old
as the goddamn Atari Falcon, now
I’ve got some green little
smartarse giving me lip for it
too? Well you can take your funny
little lines and shove them upSAM
Alice told me to say it! Okay? It
was Alice. I have literally no
context for this. At all.
Oh.

COLIN

SAM
I said you seemed kinda scary and
I didn’t know how to say hi, so
she said to ask about the app.
COLIN
‘Course she did. Well, tell Alice
it was funny. Yeah.

COLIN makes a noise that is probably meant to be a laugh.

A bit, yeah.
Huh.

SAM
So like, how is it going?

COLIN
Mate, I’ve been banging my head
against this system for almost two
years and I’ve got nothing beyond
a bug list as long my arm.
SAM
So not great then?
COLIN
‘Bout a year ago I figured out it
was written with some kind of
propriety German source code, so
you know what I did?
SAM
What?
COLIN
I learned German. But do you think
it helped? At all?
Nein?
Nein.

SAM
Well… At least it’ll help if you
ever go to Germany?

Why would going to Germany help?

I don’t- no I meant like, as a

A holiday?
SAM
Yeah, like time off? I hear they

I’m a vegetarian.

Well, this was great an’ all but I

I don’t know. I think he’s having

So you and Alice go back?
SAM
Yeah, we knew each other at uni.

SAM
To be fair, she did say the office

GWEN
That’s one way to put it, I guess.
So how did you end up here? You
don’t seem like the usual hopeless

Heh. Maybe I’m just better at

Anyone know what the deal is with
the Magnus Institute? Recently
moved back to Manchester and I’ve
been keen to keep up my
spelunking, so was looking at the
lists here of good sites to check
out.
There’s some great ones one there
(I have got to check out the old
Hippodrome at some point!), but
I’m a bit confused about the
Magnus Institute. It’s listed
under “cleared”, but there’s no
pictures or info. I get that it’s
useful to have a way of saying a
place has been explored to death,
but usually when that’s the case
there’s at least a few photos
that can be found online. Is it
worth me checking out? It’s only
a half hour from me, but I don’t
want to bother if it’s genuinely a
solved site and there’s nothing
there worth seeing.

Not sure. I don’t think ArcherK

while. Don’t remember it, though.
I say go for it – if there aren’t
any pictures about, seems like a
good reason to see for yourself.
Re: Magnus Institute Ruins

I do update them when people send
me through stuff, but it doesn’t
happen all that often. I’m mainly
just adding stuff to Devan’s old
lists from when he left. I don’t
know why he put the Magnus
Institute on the Cleared list.
Never really thought about it.
Maybe it’s been a self-fulfilling
thing, and no one’s been checking
it out because it was put on there
by accident.

Re: Magnus Institute Ruins
By RedCanary on Friday April 22

Sorry, yeah, that’s the problem.
Having a really tough time
actually uploading any of the
pictures I took. Plus not been
feeling super well. Forgot how
weirdly paranoid I can get after
spelunking. But yeah, the
building’s an odd one. Looks like
it hasn’t been touched since the
fire, and that was, what, 20 years
ago? Structure itself is in pretty
good shape – a lot of damage and
scorching, plus the third floor is
pretty much gone, but the rest of
the building is safe enough. There
was one spot where my foot went
through the floor, but tbh that
was mostly me being careless.
It's got a really cool vibe,
though. Like, if you’d told me it
was a Victorian asylum or
something before the fire I reckon
I’d have believed you. Lost of
austere old furnishings that are
still in decent nick, and a bunch
of offices like little cells. Kept
getting this sense like doors were
going to slam shut and lock behind
me, even though half the frames
didn’t even have actual doors left
in them.
Big surprise was no old papers. I
mean, they’d be mulch by now,
obviously, but all the old filing
cabinets were still rusting in

place, and there was clearly what
used to be a massive library or
archive or something in the first
basement layer. Was really
expecting a bunch of paper pulp,
but there wasn’t really any. Maybe
that’s why it was listed as
“cleared”?
Also, I don’t know how to describe
it really, but there was a bunch
of old graffiti. I don’t mean tags
or anything, I didn’t see any tags
at all, actually, and it wasn’t
your standard “YOUR SOUL IS
FORFEIT” spooky ruins graffiti, it
was like… symbols and stuff and
some pretty suspicious stains on
some floors. I don’t really know
occult or whatever, but I dunno.
Felt legit in a way most of it
doesn’t. I know a few of you do
graff stuff, so I wouldn’t mind
picking your brains about it
later.

You and everyone else. I’ve

working theory is that maybe it
got set up in the 70s, back when
everyone was off their tits on LSD
and giving ghost-hunters massive
grants to wave crystals in
graveyards. I reckon at some point
they must have put together a
small government department to,
like, oversee the spending and
monitor this stuff and no-one's
noticed it's still going.
