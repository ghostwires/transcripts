Episode Seven – Give and Take
[Music]

1. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE – NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
ALICE is sat at the computer giving CELIA an introduction to the
Freddy system.
ALICE
-so then you just hit the submit
button over here and…
There is the same tinny fanfare as always.
ALICE
(cont.)
…that’s your first case.
CELIA
Cool.
ALICE
Questions?
CELIA
Seems straightforward enough.
ALICE
(thrown)
It does?
[2]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

CELIA
Yeah. I mean, it’s an old system, but
it could have been worse. It’s not like
we’re wrestling with tape recorders
and manila folders.
ALICE
And we’re not bothered by the whole
“my skin turned into butterflies”
case?
CELIA
Nah. Can’t say butterflies really
scare me. Besides, I’m guessing all
the cases are a bit “off” and that’s
why we’re assessing them.
ALICE
…pretty much.
CELIA
You mentioned some might get read
out by the computer. Is there
anything different about those ones?
ALICE
Not really. Colin, he’s the weird IT
guy, he reckons some of the system
runs through the sound card so it
just spits them out randomly.
CELIA
You’re sure?
ALICE
Well, no. But it kinda makes sense.
CELIA
Have you ever checked to see if the
spoken cases have anything in
common?
[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ALICE
Never noticed anything obvious.
Besides, we can’t stop it either way
so mostly we just go for a coffee if
we get a chatter. Just remember
though, you’ve got to get through
your whole caseload so you can’t
waste too much time on this stuff.
CELIA
Understood.
ALICE
Anything else?
CELIA
Is there any way to look up specific
files?
ALICE
Like what?
CELIA
Oh I don’t know. Every case about
being buried alive or meat or…
whatever.
ALICE
Well, there’s a search bar, but it
doesn’t actually do anything. You’d
have to dig through them all
manually.
(suspicious)
Why do you ask?
CELIA
Just figuring it all out. Ah well, I
guess I’ll need to find Bigfoot on my
own time.

[4]

ALICE
(won over)
Ha! You joke but there was this one
case a couple of years ago...
CELIA
Let me guess, somebody got killed
by a big shoe?
Beat.
ALICE
You’ll fit right in here.
2. CYBERSPACE – (COMPUTER)
CHESTER
From
DMargolis@oxfordpeoplestrust.org
to HR@oxfordpeoplestrust.org RE:
Tendering resignation. 3rd February
2016
To whom it may concern, I am
writing to inform you that I am
tendering my resignation as
manager of the Hilltop Centre
branch of Oxford Peoples Trust
effective immediately. I will not be
working my notice period and unless
you wish for this to become a legal
matter I advise you to pay me
properly for that time.
I am aware that you may not have
been directly responsible for the
events that have taken place at the
Hilltop Centre branch over the last
six months but you have
nonetheless failed to provide
[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

adequate support despite my
repeated messages requesting your
intervention. I am thus left with no
other choice than to sever all ties
with the company which appears to
care so little for my health, goodwill
or years of service.
You will find a complete account of
all that has happened attached and
this should be more than sufficient
for your records. I shall expect my
final paycheck paid promptly and in
full.
Regards,
Dianne Margolis BA (hons), JP
Attachment reads:
I, Dianne Margolis BA (Hons), JP am
a victim of neglect from the
management of Oxford Peoples
Trust and I believe that facts stated
herein are true to the best of my
knowledge.
I was appointed to the manager role
at the Hilltop Centre branch on the
17th August 2015 after the death of
Derek Chambers, the former
manager. I had worked as a
volunteer under Mr. Chambers for
three years, two of which he was
frequently absent due to his illness.
Upon his death I was offered a full
managerial probation from Mr. C
Clayton of OPT. I completed this
probation and began managing the
site proper from the 8th November
2015.
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

It soon became apparent that though
Mr. C Clayton was my line manager,
neither he nor the Human
Resources Department would
provide any managerial oversight or
support and any requests for
assistance sourcing a replacement
volunteer for my former role would
go unanswered.
I finally resorted to personally
preparing, printing and posting A4
flyers around the Hilltop Centre in
the hopes of attracting local
volunteers already familiar with the
site. (I secured permission from the
custodians prior.)
It was on 13th November 2015 that I
received a walk-in application from
an individual seeking the position. I
understand my inability to recall his
name or find it in the relevant
paperwork or emails may affect the
credibility of my account, but the fact
remains he applied. The young
man's interview was not exceptional
as he had no experience in charity
work, no driving license nor any
demonstrable experience in retail. He
claimed however, to know the Hilltop
Centre better than anyone and as he
was the only applicant in the role I
elected to give him a try.
He began his two week probation on
14th November 2015. I notified Mr. C.
Clayton and HR of the appointment
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

and Mr. C. Clayton replied that I
should “chill” and it was “all good”.
The new volunteer had a number of
issues with his probation and
struggled with basic inventory,
stocking, till management and
cleaning duties however, he was
punctual, hardworking and had an
extremely positive disposition. He
even personally donated a rather
large false plant in a somewhat
disconcerting ceramic pot modelled
on a shouting human face.
Towards the end of his probation he
told me he was having a good time
since it was “all for a good cause”
and that he had a friend who also
wished to volunteer. I was somewhat
dubious as to how helpful an
associate of this young man would
be but given that the site still needed
at least 5 more staff members and
Mr. C. Clayton was no longer
replying to my messages, I had little
choice but to interview them.
The young woman (whose name also
escapes me at this time) began on
26th November 2015 and had a
similar level of experience, offset by
an equally enthusiastic work ethic
and demeanor. I did have to give
them an informal warning to stop
laughing so much whilst on the main
floor but they insisted “it’s all for a
good cause” and there were no
customers at the time.
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

The second volunteer also made a
donation in the form of a large
Bearskin rug. I attempted to contact
Mr C Clayton to enquire about our
policy regarding real fur items,
especially ones of such size, but was
informed that he was on a “personal
development sabbatical” and thus
unreachable. I elected to store this in
the back room, especially given the
sharpness of its teeth.
Three days after this second
probation began, she told me she
also had some friends who also
wished to volunteer. As I was still
technically understaffed I agreed to
meet with them. I normally would not
have accepted so many new starters
at once but with the Christmas
period approaching and still no reply
from Mr. C Clayton I feel I made a
managerial decision that was clearly
within my jurisdiction.
The next two volunteers started on
the 28th November 2015. They also
made donations of a large chandelier
of dark glass and an oversized
gramophone with a collection of
records of what I believe to be
religious plainsong. I was surprised
that young adults would donate such
exotic items and explained it was not
necessary but they insisted claiming
it was “all for a good cause”.
The previous volunteers began to
onboard the new starters whilst I
updated the branches ledgers,
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

documentation and the other
paperwork that has since been lost. I
attempted to submit standard
monthly reports during this time but
Mr. C Clayton had not yet returned
from his sabbatical which I had by
then learned was with full pay in the
Seychelles. I'm sure he had a lovely
time.
On the 30th November, I was
introduced to four more
“volunteers”. It seemed that my
instructions had been misconstrued
and all of them had already been
offered a position. I explained that
this was contrary to the Oxford
People's Trust's normal hiring
policies but I elected to nonetheless
offer them a probation in order to
fully fill the volunteer roster for the
Christmas period.
I expressly notified the young man I
had hired first however, that he
should not imply any further
volunteer roles were available.
All four of them started the same day
and despite me being very clear that
it was not necessary they had also
brought personal donations in the
form of A crudely-carved rocking
horse, a grandfather clock that
leaked some sort of dark oil, A
heavily vandalized set of the
Encyclopedia Britannica and an
extensive collection of abstract
canvas artworks respectively. I told
them these were not fit for sale, but
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

my instructions to remove them were
disregarded. It was at this point I
began to sense that I was starting to
lose control of the situation.
On the 1st of December I arrived to
find that the new hires had already
opened the shop. To be clear I had
not provided any keys and remain
unsure how they obtained a set. I
intended to pursue the matter
immediately but was initially unable
to locate them behind all the
additional donations they appeared
to have accepted.
None of the items were fit for sale. I
specifically recall two large, soiled
Crinoline dresses, a Chaise Longue
with cushions filled with some sort
of coarse sand, a taxidermied
vulture, a rusty antique printing
press and a collection of old medical
equipment that had seemingly been
recently used. There were many,
many additional items but I was
unable to take a full inventory as the
shopfloor was overfull.
With great difficulty I found the
young man I had originally hired
towards the back of the shop
laughing with a large group of young
adults including the previous
volunteers and multiple others I did
not recognize. I told them that social
gatherings were not permitted during
work hours but he insisted they were
all volunteers and when I attempted
to tell them all to leave the premises
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

they laughed and continued bringing
in additional items.
It was clear by this time that this
situation required intervention from
head office and so I began to push
my way through to the landline but
as I did so I saw yet more people
entering the shop with donations:
some sort of leather kite, an oddly
curved brass telescope, a
wheelbarrow full of shifting fossils,
an armload of swords, lengths of
rope… and they were all laughing
and calling out to one another “it’s
all for a good cause!”
As more and more people arrived,
pressing into the shop, the central
shelving was toppled and items were
being damaged underfoot. A tin
bathtub filled with moldy food, a
stack of old dental retainers, a brace
of half-butchered pheasants, jars of
what appeared to be pickled hands; I
could no longer see the exits and
still more volunteers pushed
themselves inwards.
The pressure grew unbearable and I
was pinned on all sides, my
shoulders crushed against an
ancient diving suit filled with
sawdust, with my neck wrenched
under a broken picnic hamper whilst
bloodstained china was ground
beneath my feet. There wasn’t even
enough space to fall now.
I tried to scream but could only
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

manage a wheeze as I began to
blackout. My limbs were contorted
and gouged by unseen edges, my
mouth filling with the copper taste of
imperial coins pouring down on me
from a jar above.
That’s when the gunshots started.
The volunteers didn’t stop laughing
but I could feel the deadened thud of
impacts and I could see spatters of
gore through what gaps there were
in the items all around me. Again and
again there was a rapid thud-thudthud and the laughing voices began
to be drowned out by the growing
crackle of flames.
Without warning, the pressure
lessened and I dropped into a small
hollow beneath an upturned
bookcase. There was a path ahead of
me, jagged with shards of wood and
glass were constantly shifting with
the press of the crowd. I dragged
myself forward over the broken
detritus occasionally getting caught
but pressing onwards until I tumbled
out of the emergency exit and onto
the tarmac outside.
Dazed, I tried to get to my feet only
to be shoved to the ground by a
heavyset man in black clothing, who
demanded I identify myself while
pressing a gun against the back of
my head.
I screamed, then I wept, great
heaving sobs of terror with broken
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ribs. This somehow seemed to
satisfy him and he threw me roughly
over his shoulder and walked away
from the Hilltop Centre as the charity
shop blazed behind us. I swear I
could still hear them laughing over
the thudding of machine guns and
the roar of unchecked fire…
It has been made very clear to me
that I am not to identify the security
firm that took this action, so I shall
not do so here. Nor am I aware of
which individual or organisation
hired them, except in as far as I know
for a fact they were not working for
the Oxford People's Trust.
They have also expressed in no
uncertain terms that the fire is to be
treated as an accident, with no
further investigation by OPT. If you
wish to discuss this further with
them, I can provide you contact
information, but I heavily advise
against it. Unless you send Mr. C
Clayton, of course. I rather think he
deserves to be fully debriefed by
them.
Do not contact me again unless it is
to discuss additional compensation.

3. INT. OIAR OFFICE – NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
CELIA is breathing heavily. ALICE notices and pulls out her
headphones.
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ALICE
Everything all right?
CELIA
No, yeah I’m fine just... the voice
threw me.
ALICE
Who Chester? He’s not so bad.
Better than Norris, whiny little toad.
CELIA
I’m sorry?
ALICE
There’s three voices.
CELIA
And those are their names?
ALICE
Well, that’s what I call them, at least.
CELIA
Chester, Norris and…
ALICE
Augustus.
CELIA
Right.
Beat.
ALICE
Listen if you need to step out for
some airCELIA
No I’m fine really. Do you know who
voices “Chester”?

[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

ALICE
Uh, no? Why? Looking for an
autograph?
CELIA
Just thought I recognised it for a
moment..
ALICE
I mean, the system’s was built in the
90s – maybe they got like a radio guy
to do it and you heard him as a kid?
CELIA
Maybe. Doesn’t matter. I’m sure it
wasn’t anyone important.

4. I.T. “OFFICE” – NIGHT, CLEAR (SAM’S PHONE)
SAM stands in the corridor and knocks on the metallic door to
the IT office. There are the distinct sounds of someone typing on
a keyboard in the room, it doesn’t sound like it’s going well.
SAM
(hesitant)
Hello?
There is a muffled swear behind the door and then it is yanked
open.
COLIN
What? Oh it’s you.
SAM
Yeah, hi.
COLIN
What do you want?

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
Sorry, I don’t want to interrupt you
or(he sees the look on
COLIN’s face)
Uh anyway yeah, I was wondering if
you knew who “John” was?
COLIN
John who?
SAM
Great question.
COLIN
What.
SAM
I got a weird email from
“John” with a random name and an
address and it looks like it’s from an
internal email so…
COLIN
There’s no one here called John.
SAM
Oh right. You’re sure?
COLIN
Yes.
Beat.
SAM
Well is there someone else I could
ask or…
COLIN
Listen mate. If you’re going to get
this worked up over a weird email

[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

you’re going to freak when you see
the real stuff.
SAM
What… real stuff?
COLIN
Oh you’ll see.
SAM
(looking over Colin’s
shoulder)
Is that why you’ve taped over your
webcam?
COLIN
You finished?
SAM
(pulling out his phone)
Well listen, if you see anything from
this email addressCOLIN
Hey! Put that away! Didn’t you see
the sign?
SAM
Yeah, “No external electronics”, butCOLIN
(growing furious)
But you thought that didn’t apply to
you?
SAM
It’s just a phone, I didn’t thinkCOLIN
No you didn’t. Of all the brainless,
idiotic stupid- -

[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

SAM
Look, I’m… I’m going to go.
He starts to leave.
COLIN
Give me that!
SAM
Get off!
COLIN
It’s already recorded tooThere is a scuffle. The recording is cut off as the phone falls to
the floor and breaks.
5. INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE – NIGHT, WINDY (MANAGER’S
LANDLINE)
LENA is sat speaking on the phone, we do not hear the man on
the other end of the line but it sounds like he is in a restaurant or
similar environment.
LENA
-of course, but I can assure you that
there really is no need toGWEN enters abruptly.
LENA
(cont.)
Worry. Now I do apologize but
something has just come up so I
have to go. I will get everything over
to you as soon as I can. Please
excuse me.
LENA puts the phone down and the line disconnects but we can
still hear.

[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

LENA
(cont.)
You’re supposed to knock before
entering.
GWEN
I know.
LENA
Then I trust there is some emergency
which justifies this interruption?
GWEN
(approaching the desk)
I thought you’d want to see this.
LENA
What is it?
GWEN
It’s really quite amusing, actually.
LENA
(readying for a fight)
Gwen what exactly are you- [playing
at]
GWEN
(threatening)
Trust me.
Beat. Lena takes GWEN’s phone and starts a video. The audio
quality is very poor.
KLAUS
(Phone video, begging)
Please. Please, you don’t have to do
this.
YOUNGER LENA
(Phone video)
We both know I do.
[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

KLAUS
(Phone video)
I I-could disappear again! They
would never know!
YOUNGER LENA
(Phone video)
I’m sorry Klaus.
Beat.
KLAUS
(Phone video)
Well, so am I.
There is a struggle. YOUGER LENA is thrown to the floor and
Klaus flees. There is a Gunshot. Klaus cries out but keeps
stumbling away.
YOUNGER LENA
(Phone video, coughing)
Klaus! Klaus! Shit…
LENA stops the video.
Beat.
LENA
You are aware that most people
would consider directly confronting
me like this a rather foolish idea?
GWEN
But that’s why it’s so funny you see?
Because not only do I have a video
of you trying to murder someone,
even better, I have multiple copies of
you failing to do so.
LENA
And that is better because?

[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

GWEN
Because I suspect the only thing
worse than being convicted for
attempted murder is being punished
by the people who paid for it.
LENA
And you believe they don’t already
know?
GWEN
According to my source, they believe
this man to be quite dead.
LENA
Source. Singular. Interesting.
Beat.
LENA CONT’D
And who do you imagine my masters
to be in this scenario?
GWEN
Whoever they are, I suspect they
have the power to reward me for
alerting them to your incompetence.
Maybe with your job.
Beat. Lena takes a deep breath.
LENA
You have ambition, Gwen, I will grant
you that, but not a lot of imagination.
You are blackmailing me personally,
correct? For what? I am not a
wealthy woman, certainly not
compared to your own family. What
is it that you want?
GWEN
I want “in”.
[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

LENA
Really?
Beat.
LENA
(cont.)
I would want to know how you
obtained this information.
GWEN
Too bad.
Beat. LENA chuckles slightly.
GWEN
(thrown)
What?
LENA
It’s simply a bit unexpected. Perhaps
you have more stomach for this work
than I gave you credit for. And I have
been needing someone to step up to
the real work for quite some time
now.
GWEN
Meaning what exactly?
LENA
(Pulling out paperwork)
If you want answers and authority,
you’ll have you chance to earn them.
I am appointing you as the new
“Externals Liaison.”
GWEN
A… promotion?

[23]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Private & Confidential

LENA
Of a sort. I hope you’re as ready for it
as you think you are. Consider
yourself “in”.
