THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER
Rusty Quill presents Chapter and Multiverse
[SFX: Tavern Ambience]

Ah, you’ve returned! Wonderful. I take it you’re not just here for the excellent
beverages? But of course, you want to know what happened next to our young
protagonists? I’d be very happy to tell you. Last time we saw them, they had
been invited to join TARGE, the governmental agency responsible for
superheroes. As they made their way to the rendezvous at the Tip Top Coffee
Shop, that was the first time that I had the opportunity to say hello.

[SFX: Sci-Fi whoosh]

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Hello and welcome to Chapter and Multiverse, the actual play podcast where
we explore the same city across multiple parallel universes. I am your game
master Maddy Searle, pronouns she/her, and today we will be continuing our
campaign of Masks: a New Generation, which is designed by Brendan Conway
and allows players to take on the role of young superheroes. But before we go
any further I must introduce our wonderful and talented players. Could you
please let me know your name and pronouns and your character's name and
pronouns, starting with Pip.

PIP
Hello, I'm Pip Gladwin, he/him, and I will be playing Joseph Teller, otherwise
known as Zenith, also he/him.

MADDY
Fabulous. And Lowri?

LOWRI
Hello! I am Lowri Ann Davies and I am playing Blodeuwedd Morgan. Both of
us go by she/her pronouns.

MADDY
Wonderful. And Ahmed?

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED
Hi, I'm Ahmed Aljabry and I will be playing Adeeb, who is also known as The
Turban. His pronouns are he and him.

MADDY
Fabulous. And Lydia?

LYDIA
Hello, I am Lydia Nicholas. My pronouns are she/they and I am playing Mini
Smithson who mostly uses she/her, who is sometimes known as - wait, no! I
haven't revealed the-

MADDY
No!

LYDIA
Hero name? No! OK! Right!

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Mysteries await you!

PIP
That was close!

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Dun-dun-daa!

MADDY
Near miss!

LYDIA
Also totally not a hero, like absolutely a human, that is, yeah, I don't know why
she's even involved in this, er, because she's totally a human…

LOWRI
Yeah, you didn't mention that last time. I'm just saying.

LYDIA
I know, it didn't - it didn't come up!

PIP
Well that is - you've been sitting on that information.

LOWRI
Yeah.

4

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
You've been very tight-lipped about the fact that they're totally human.

LYDIA
Totally a human. Yeah.

PIP
I didn't know that. That's like the only thing I knew about your character.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Yeah. No, it's cool!

AHMED
Yeah, in my, I have like a page for each character and I have only one line for
Mini.

(Group laughter)

AHMED
"Totally a human."

5

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA
Yeah! Like - there are other, there are as many other salient facts about her as
there are about other humans.

MADDY
Mm hm.

LOWRI

Good to know.

PIP
[laughs]

LYDIA
Just fill those in!

PIP
This is all useful information! It's definitely not getting cut!

(Group laughter)

LOWRI
Oh it's not getting cut, this is my favourite bit that we've come up with yet, so-!
[laughs]
6

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY
And so last we left off each of our four young heroes had just discovered that
they had been selected to join a superhero team by TARGE, the Tactical Agency
for Rescue and Guidance in Emergencies. It is the government agency
responsible for superheroes and you are asked to attend your first briefing the
following day at 11.00am. The rendezvous is the Tip Top Coffee Shop on
Victory Road and your supervisor, Vera Constantine, will meet you and escort
you to HQ. And so as we reach closer and closer to 11.00am, who do you think
would arrive at the coffee shop first? Who's the most punctual of you?

[SFX: Tip Top Coffee Shop interior]

AHMED
I have already thought about this, and Adeeb would arrive, like, an hour early.

[SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles; Outside Tip Top Coffee shop]

(Group laughter)

AHMED
And then he would go to another place nearby and then he will enter the place
within a few minutes of the time. [SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles]
Like, he would just take a glance outside and then will go to somewhere
nearby.

7

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Yeah. I, I can relate to that heavily!

(Group laughter)

MADDY
Absolutely, yeah. You can find the local Barstucks coffee shop- [SFX: Door
opens; Barstucks Coffee Shop interior]

(Group laughter)

MADDY
- the chain that is so prominent in Chapter and have a mediocre coffee there
for an hour and then rock up.

LYDIA
If I understand Chapter correctly - which I don't -

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
-many things that are established will have some continuity across space and
time. So Barstucks is now canon.

[Music: Calm ambience]

8

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
Yeah.

LYDIA
Whatever happens, I'm pretty sure that there will now be some, like, craggy
wanderers scaling a cliff, going into a caldera to meet-

LOWRI
[laughs]

LYDIA
-you know, the Count Doom, and the little, the little person with the cart be
like: "Barstucks! Who needs some Barstucks!"

AHMED
[laughs]

LOWRI
Absolutely! And I'm really pleased about this introduction to our canon.

(Group laughter)

MADDY
Yeah, the best things come when I am very tired in the mornings and just
swapping letters around in established brands to avoid being sued.
9

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

(Group laughter)

MADDY
So, who after Ahmed do you think would arrive?

PIP
Um, I don't wanna like, I'm not, this isn't me trying to one-up anybody-

LYDIA
You're gonna be even earlier! [laughs]

PIP
I think Joseph's been on the rooftop opposite this coffee shop since the m- like
probably about 5am?

[SFX: City Rooftop, wind blowing and cars passing]

(Group laughter)

LOWRI
Oh my god!

MADDY
Amazing! [laughs]
10

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
Yeah, just like and around it just like, full surveillance. You know he's, he's
checking entrances, exits, security cameras, trying to see if TARGE has like set
anything up in advance, you know, trying to see if they've got agents like hiding
around the - yeah, he's been there for a while.

MADDY
Amazing. Both Adeeb and Joseph can see at their various interpretations of
"early", a strange time-capsule of a coffee shop in this very modern district
that is all chrome and glass and shiny and corporate. It is this little oldfashioned coffee shop with beautiful gold lettering over the, over the door and
stuffed to the brim with antique coffee paraphernalia, some lovely plants
around there, [SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles] and Adeeb as you go
in you can see that there is a middle-aged man behind the bar wearing a red
silk waistcoat and busying himself with a very arcane looking espresso
machine.

AHMED
I will sit down on the bar stool, on the, next to the counter and I will just wait
for him 'til he figures it out because I don't wanna interrupt him, I see him like
really frustrated with this machine. [laughs] So I patiently wait until he notices
me. [SFX: Squeak of barstool; arcane espresso machine creaking and
whirring]

11

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Yeah it takes, takes a few minutes of sort of muttering under his breath and
then eventually he turns around and goes:

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Ah! Hello there! Um, I'm so sorry, I hope you weren't waiting long.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh no, I just got here.

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Can I get you anything?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Mm, I will have anything chocolatey.

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Well I have just the thing for you.

MADDY
And he turns around, starts frothing up some milk, starts getting some cocoa
powder together and within a few minutes you have this incredible confection
with whipped cream up to the sky and sprinkles and marshmallows out the
wazoo. [SFX: Frothing milk, whipped cream from a spray can]

12

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
(Group laughter)

AHMED
I immediately put my credit card in front of me and start drinking this, this
celebration of chocolate! [laughs] [SFX: Setting credit card down on bar]

MADDY
Yeah, he gladly takes the credit card and taps it on the contactless card reader
and hands it back to you and yeah, it is the most delicious thing you have ever
had, it is incredible. [SFX: Picking up card and tapping it on the reader]

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Mmmm… so good.

MADDY
And he turns to you and says:

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
I get the feeling that this is a very important day for you, I am not really sure
what, what gives me that impression.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Is it, is it, is it my clothes, like am I wearing too formal? Like I thought like the
vest is just too much and the, but, I thought the, the scarf would make it less
formal and I have no idea right now.
13

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
I appreciate formal attire as you can probably tell, that is my usual mode of
dress. I, I very much appreciate your sense of style.

[SFX: City Rooftop]

MADDY
And at this point do you think Joseph would possibly enter or is he-?

(Group laughter)

PIP
No!

MADDY
Still waiting! Waiting for everyone to arrive?

PIP
I'll say it now, 100% waiting for everyone else to get there before I, yeah, sorry
to be "that guy", but I've literally made a character who's that guy!

(Group laughter)

AHMED
I don't think he would know who's everybody else.
14

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
This is very true. This is very true. I don't, I don't necessarily know who
everybody else is, so I mean, if you'll let me I'm 100% listening to this
conversation through a laser microphone.

LYDIA and LOWRI
[laughing]

MADDY
Yeah, sure!

(Group laughter)

PIP
And have probably, I don't know there's like a, I don't know, because Adeeb
and I, not that I knew Adeeb's secret identity.

AHMED
Yeah.

PIP
Adeeb and I have crossed paths in the superhero-ing world before. So it's like do I recognise this guy's voice? [laughs]

15

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Why don't we do the first roll of the game.

LYDIA
[gasps]

LOWRI
Yaaaay! First roll, first roll!

MADDY
And why don't you do a roll to pierce the mask.

PIP
OK.

MADDY
So you roll plus mundane.

PIP
Yeah.

MADDY
7 to 9 is a mixed success, 10 plus is a full success.

16

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
OK. It's two D6 for the listeners at home. All right. (ROLL) Aw, it's not good
enough. It's a 5.

MADDY
It's a 5, all right. Yeah, this is just a lovely young man who has got a bit too
excited about some kind of meeting and has dressed a little too formally for
the occasion.

LOWRI
Aww!

PIP
Well then I guess instead of like it being a: oh I'm gonna wait for everyone to
show up, because obviously I don't know who the other people who've been
the sent the same message are, I'm just gonna wait until it's clear some kind of
meeting is happening basically. Like that's what they've asked for so yeah, I
will continue to lurk.

MADDY
Fair. And out of Morgan and Mini, who do you think would arrive next?

LOWRI
Well Morgan - she doesn't WANT to be late.

(Group laughter)
17

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
[SFX: Outside Tip Top Coffee Shop]

LOWRI
But she's probably going to be a little bit late. This is very, very new for her. So
I mean if it's OK she'll probably arrive at about like, well I say late, she'll, she's
very excited about this but she does get up late, it's going to be 11.00 on the
dot I think that she kind of runs around the corner and you won't know
because, well, 1 - you've never met her and 2 - if you had seen her before she'll
look exactly the same but the clothes she's wearing are like the best version of
the clothes she has, like the best white tank top that she has and the best
jeans, because this is new for her, she doesn't meet people, full stop. [laughs]
So it's, she's a bit nervous.

MADDY
[SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles; Tip Top Coffee Shop interior] Fair.
And yeah, as you enter you can see that Adeeb is sitting up at the bar having a
little conversation with the proprietor. There is a diverse clientele, some
businesspeople, some students, some elderly folks just having a, having a little
morning cuppa.

LOWRI
If no one looks like they're from TARGE or like there's a meeting going on, you
mentioned that there were plants, Morgan's gonna find the biggest plant and
just like - well and sit next to it, basically.

(Group laughter)
18

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LOWRI
She's not gonna be very good at hiding away, you know, but she's obviously
not very comfortable in this environment, she doesn't know how coffee shops
really work to be honest. This is a new experience.

LYDIA
An emotional support monstera.

MADDY
For sure, yeah, you can find a particularly abundant fern in a corner and sort of
nestle beside it. [SFX: Sitting, disturbing the fern]

LOWRI
Exactly, yeah.

MADDY
And I think at this point the proprietor of the coffee shop catches your eye and
just kind of like:

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Can I help you?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah, er, I'm here to meet some… people.
19

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Well that's lovely. Um, I'm afraid I am not aware of a particular meeting
happening today but you are welcome to wait and I'll let you know if I spot
anything.

LOWRI
Maddy, have we been, sorry, were we told the name of the person we're
meeting in the texts?

MADDY
Yes, it was Vera Constantine.

LOWRI
Oh! Then Morgan will say:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I'm here to meet Vera.

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Vera? Oh yes, she does come in here from time to time, one of those TARGE
folks. Yes, absolutely. Yes, when I spot her I'll let you know so that you can go
and meet her.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Thanks. I'll um - I'll be by the fern.
20

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Good! Good. It's a particular nice, one I'm very proud of it.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
It is, it's, it's quite old isn't it?

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Yes, I've had it many years. It's er, it's been through a lot with me and a lot of
different places, I do travel a lot and I like to take some remnants of my past
lives with me as I go.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh wow! That's, that's cool. Actually, could I maybe get just like a black tea,
with sugar please?

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Absolutely yes, of course.

MADDY
And very quickly a black tea is presented to you. It is a very lovely kind of
Assam. [SFX: Rattling of teacup]

LOWRI
Ooh, nice.
21

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY
Leaf tea, very smoky and-

LOWRI
Malty.

MADDY
Delicious, yeah.

LOWRI
Mm.

MADDY
At this point you're probably up at the bar beside Adeeb-

LOWRI
Yeah.

MADDY
If Adeeb is still there.

AHMED
Yeah. At this point like how much time has passed since our time of meeting,
like 5 minutes, 10 minutes?
22

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY
Since you met the proprietor of the coffee shop or-?

AHMED
Yeah.

MADDY
It's probably, it's probably been just a few minutes, it's not been very long.

AHMED
OK, so I'm gonna keep my eye on the door waiting for anyone that looks like
they could be named Vera…

(Group laughter)

AHMED
I have no point of reference so I'm just gonna just watch anyone coming in.

MADDY
Mm.

AHMED
I'm guessing.

23

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Absolutely. Is this the time that Mini would possibly come in or is it even later
than this?

LYDIA
Mini's gonna be like a couple of minutes late because Mini took the bus and-

[SFX: Bus interior]

MADDY
Ah…

[SFX: Bus door opens]

PIP
Like a human would do.

LYDIA
Yeah, like, absolutely like a human would do! And, and, and Mini is, is dressed
in very human gear. You know those, you know those like five minute craft or
like Tik-Toks where people get-

PIP
Sorry, they're Bing-Bongs.

24

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
Not Tik-Toks.

LYDIA
Oh yes sorry - well I was talking about THIS world, but…

LOWRI
Oh right, sorry!

(Group laughter)

PIP
Just trying to drill it into her!

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Oh OK, yes, those - you know those short videos that one can access online on
a variety of different platforms?

(Group laughter)

LOWRI
Yes!

25

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA
Where people have like jogging bottoms and they, they wear one leg as like a
slip-on dress and then like the other leg like wraps, somehow wraps around
them and it looks super-formal? Like, and I've actually mostly seen it done by,
by big beardy men that are like - being like - how does it, this actually works on
me? This is awesome. Because I'm, I'm just on the side of Tik-Tok where
trends are deconstructed and then have to reconstruct the trend, like,
backwards.

LOWRI
Nice. [laughs]

LYDIA
But anyway, THAT is what Mini is wearing because Mini has realised it's a
formal thing and then as like, you know, for a sort of belt thing they've got like
oversized costume jewellery that they've then kind of extended. Am I living
through Mini's style? Slightly. Anyway-

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
But it looks formal. But again, there's something about it that you're just like…
[high pitched] is that? What-? That's not-? What's-? Does not quite compute!

(Group laughter)

26

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
Is there just like - one of the pockets is inside out and just sticking out of the
side…

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Like yeah - like no, no, it looks good, like there's some-

LOWRI
Oh, OK!

LYDIA
The sum has computed but there's like a remainder that you don't know what
to do with. It's that kind of algebra with-

LOWRI
What is this K we're left with?

LYDIA
Yeah! Right! It's just something strange. Anyway - she turns up and she's like:

LYDIA (as MINI)
[SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles] Oh! Hello! Um, I would er, I'd like a
coffee please. Thank you, that would be delightful.
27

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED
I, I probably recognise her the moment she walks in.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ohhhh! Adeeb!

AHMED
I'm then drinking - I would be like drinking my thing and looking up and seeing
her like:

AHMED (as ADEEB)
[imitates spraying out his mouthful of hot chocolate in shock] Ah!

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Mini runs over and says:

LYDIA (as MINI)
Hug?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Sure, sure!
28

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yay!

[SFX: Hug]

AHMED
And hug, and I'm just like shocked by the outfit and I'm not sure what to do or
what to say.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
How have you been?

LYDIA
I have to underline that the outfit works, right?

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Like - you're all like "oh this looks weird", no, it works!

LOWRI
Oh I'm on board! I'm on board. Morgan is sipping her tea, like:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Wow, she looks so smart!
29

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA
Thank you!

LOWRI
[laughs] I mean doesn't say it out loud, but thinks it.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Hiiiii! What a coincidence!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yes!

LYDIA
Actually no it's probably not a coincidence now I think about what the message
was about that actually makes complete sense. Yeah.

(Group laughter)

AHMED (as ADEEB)
M- message?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, you're here to meet Vera? I'm guessing? Hm?

30

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Um, yes!
LYDIA (as MINI)
Lovely!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Wait, are you Vera? You're not Vera are you?

LYDIA (as MINI)
No I'm, I'm Mini. Is it usual to have several names?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
I heard, maybe like I don't know, maybe like a code name or something?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh, OK. Um, no, well Vera isn't any of my names.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh.

LYDIA (as MINI)
I, I could change it! Is that normal? No? It's cool. I'm - I'm Mini.

31

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED (as ADEEB)
Well, have a seat! Do you want some of this er hot chocolate? It's really good.

LYDIA (as MINI)
That does look amazing actually.

AHMED
So I order one for her as well.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh I'll have that as well as my coffee I suppose which I've already ordered.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
But you know what? I love both. So yay!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh you don't have any allergies or something, right?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er-

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Because I can taste, er, some nuts.
32

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA (as MINI)
Not to anything on this planet, no.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
[laughs] All right.

LOWRI
Morgan I imagine heard that, having noticed Mini's wonderful attire will have
been, you know, listening to the conversation and will have heard you mention
Vera so will probably come over a little tentatively and be like:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Hey, um, you're here to meet Vera as well?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh my gosh yes! Yes!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Hi…

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Hi.

33

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
Hi! I'm Mini, that's my name as well as, er, a description.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Ah!

LYDIA (as MINI)
What's your name?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I'm, er, Morgan. Morgan.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh, right.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Nice to meet you.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Hi Morgan Morgan.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Hi Morgan.

(Group laughter)
34

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED
I, I just wave. I don't shake hands or anything, I just wave holding my very
large cup.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Hi - Adeeb!

LOWRI
Morgan does what I just did and just kind of nods.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Ni- nice to meet you. So this is pretty cool, hey? I guess…

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, yes.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
TARGE. It's like - big deal!

LYDIA (as MINI)
[whispers] Right!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah…
35

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Wait, am I supposed to, like, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say or not to
say.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Hm. That's not a familiar feeling to me at all.

LOWRI
[laughs]

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah um so, I guess, what can you guys do?

AHMED (as ADEEB)

Oh, um, wait, are we supposed to be talking about this?

AHMED
Um I'm, I'm just stuck right now, I'm like, I'm not sure what to say and just keep
quiet and just look to the ground.

LOWRI
Oh, did I say - oh I've just realised this is going to be such an awkward
conversation because Morgan also cannot interact with people! [laughs]
36

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA (as MINI)
I'm a journalist!

AHMED
And I have never told anyone aside my sister who I actually am or what I can
do, and Mini is just connecting the guesses so I don't know if she has an even
idea.

LOWRI
Well I think Morgan has enough sense that maybe she's realised that she's
committed a bit of a social faux-pas and is like:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh um, no, you know, it's, it's fine.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh I'm, I'm really good with er, er, clothes and outfits.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I, I can see! You look great!

LYDIA (as MINI)
Like incredible!

37

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Did you design, er, Mini's was it? Mini's outfit?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh! No, but that's how we met. I am a journalist but I also, er, sell shoes and
er Adeeb is, works through shoes pretty fast.

AHMED
[laughs]

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh!

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, some would say suspiciously so!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
[laughs] Shhh!

LYDIA (as MINI)
But wait so that means that we, we end up like hanging out and we just got
talking about style. And no, er, actually he didn't design this but I wish that he
would design something for me-

38

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yeah this is, this is all Mini!

LYDIA (as MINI)
That would be so cool.

LOWRI
Morgan is suddenly realising: oh my gosh, everyone's gonna know each other
and I don't know anyone.

LYDIA
[laughs] Aww!

LOWRI
She's a bit like:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh. Oh, great, so…

LYDIA (as MINI)
What do you do? Do you have a job?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um, no…

39

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
Any hobbies?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah, um-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ooh, what are they?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um, I actually, I have um, I, I, I'm quite green-fingered I guess you could say.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um yeah I, I've got some plants. Like actually this fern, like this café has a lot of
really nice, nice plants.

LYDIA (as MINI)
What's your favourite plant?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh, well at the moment I've had a bit of a breakthrough with a fern, so.

40

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
Wow.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I'm actually quite partial to a fern at the moment but um-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oooh.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah, I've got quite a lot of you know, succulents and things from all over the
world really.

LYDIA
Mini starts taking notes [SFX: Writing]

(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
And so like, if you were to rank the top ten plants…

AHMED
[laughs]

41

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah…

LYDIA (as MINI)
Like, with any facts that you just wouldn't believe if you weren't aware of
plants, like how would you do that?

(Group laughter)

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um, well…

[Music: Calm ambience]

LYDIA
This is gonna continue by the way, like-

PIP
Oh I hope so! [laughs]

MADDY
Yeah, we fade out and-

42

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
Lowri is so grateful because she's realising she's gonna have to learn about
plants now! [laughs]

MADDY
The peril of any RPG character with an expertise that is not your own! I
absolutely feel that! Yeah, so yeah, as the camera pans away and the
conversation fades into the background we can see that Joseph is still perched
on top of this building opposite the coffee shop.

[SFX: City Rooftop]

(Group laughter)

PIP
Yup. Been listening to the conversation so far and I will switch off the mic
[SFX: Flicking a switch] and er, I'm gonna real quick I'm just gonna tap my
communicator and I'm gonna call, um, Aquila.

[SFX: Comms pick-up chime]

MADDY (as AQUILA)
(On the communicator) Hello?

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Um, we're sure about this, right?
43

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY (as AQUILA)
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't you be?

PIP (as JOSEPH)
I just… and I tell them who, who I am, like…?

MADDY (as AQUILA)
Yes. This is what we've been training for, this is, this is your job. This is what
you're for.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Understood. Understood. Er, going in. I'll call when it's done.

MADDY (as AQUILA)
Good.

PIP
And I'll sign off [SFX: Comms disconnection chime] and sort of walk to the
other, not the side of the building that's facing the coffee shop, just hop to the
other side and descend sort of three stories without a rope. [SFX: Parkour]

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Oooh!
44

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

(Group laughter)

PIP
Just sort of hopping between balconies and fire escapes and land in the street,
and then pop through an alleyway and approach the coffee shop, obviously
not in costume. Yeah, just, black jeans, shoes, like grey t-shirt, grey hoodie,
like there's nothing, yeah. I don't even wanna describe what he's wearing
because it's just so dull.

(Group laughter)

PIP
Yeah. And I'll stop at the door and like [takes deep breath, as if to fortify
himself]. And then walk in.

[SFX: Door opens and closes, bell jingles]

MADDY
All right yes, you see this very awkward trio gathered at the bar.

LYDIA (as MINI)
We're not awkward! We're having a delightful conversation! Yeah!

45

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP (as JOSEPH)
Oh don't worry, I'm here to make this way less awkward guys, don't worry.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Mini's bringing the energy.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah and um I actually quite like snowdrops as well because they're really
resilient-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ooh!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
-like it's, it gets really cold and they still-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yeah!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
You know they kind of come through the frosty ground and…

46

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
Well that's lovely!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
You know my family have like er date trees from our ancestral lands.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
[gasps] Oh wow!

LYDIA (as MINI)
Wow!

AHMED
And I pick out like three dates from my pocket. [SFX: Taking dates from his
pocket]

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Do you wanna try?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh!

LYDIA (as MINI)
[gasps] I'd absolutely love to!

47

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED (as ADEEB)
My mother doesn't let me leave the house without one.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yes, yes please.

AHMED
So I hand each one of them one.

MADDY
Aww!

LYDIA (as MINI)
Thank you!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
It's very sweet!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Thanks!

LYDIA
Mini chows down.

48

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
Yeah.

LYDIA (as MINI)
[with her mouth full] This is so good!

LOWRI
[laughs]

LYDIA
Mini wasn't aware that there was a seed inside, I'm gonna assume it's one of
the whole ones and think, and like there is a like "crunch".

(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh! Oh OK!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh! Ew, your teeth are gonna hurt! [laughs]

LYDIA (as MINI)
Are they? Are they gonna hurt? OK. Ow! My teeth hurt!

(Group laughter)
49

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED (as ADEEB)
It's really solid and like you, I don't think you can bite through them, no!

LYDIA
Oh I, I know, I've got a, I'm getting through my, it's the time of year for dates,
we have a stack of them and I just hurt my tooth on one this morning, so…

AHMED
[laughing]

LYDIA
This is method acting!

LOWRI
[laughs]

LYDIA
Lowri where you're like "oh I'm gonna have new expertise". No, no. Just, just
build on what happened to you today!

LOWRI
[laughs] Yeah, good, that is what I should have done!

(Group laughter)
50

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA
Anyway, Mini's delighted by the, by the gift.

LOWRI
Morgan is, feels a bit more at ease now that it's, it's like you've extended a
hand of friendship and it's lovely.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Thanks Adeeb.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
You're welcome.

MADDY
Is Joseph just kind of loitering at the edge of this conversation? I'd like to
know!

(Group laughter)
PIP
Yeah, completely unnoticed!

(Group laughter)

51

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
PIP
Just standing in the doorway. No, I think Joseph will, will walk in very sort of
quietly, order a coffee and then go sit down at a table and will wait for this
very late now I assume Vera person to show up. [SFX: Sitting]

LOWRI
[laughs]

PIP
It's extremely unprofessional! [laughs]

ALL
[all agree]

MADDY
Yeah it's very unprofessional, it's about ten past, it's, tut-tut, it's not looking
good. But yes, after a few more minutes of conversation about dates and
plants and all kinds of lovely things you see a very harassed-looking young
black woman walk through the door. [SFX: Door opens and closes, bell
jingles] She's got a very smart grey suit on and a lanyard and around the
lanyard you can see that there is the initials of TARGE kind of repeated across
the fabric. And she kind of glances around and, and recognises the group of
three instantly. And is like:

52

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh, um, I'm so sorry I'm late. There was um, there were some statistics on
crime and the, that we had to go over and, yeah, my colleagues love talking
about everything. I'm Vera, it's lovely to meet you. I assume that you are
Morgan, Mini and Adeeb?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh, yeah.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Hi! Yeah!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah, hi.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Hi.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yeah, it's great to meet you. Er, have you seen a young man anywhere, goes
by the name of Joseph?

53

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
And she's looking around and like she, like, you are in her eyeline as she's just
glancing right over you. [laughs]

PIP
If there's a moment where she's kind of looking around, I will like just lift a
hand slightly off the table in like a "hey" kind of gesture.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Ah.

LYDIA
Are you so nondescript and is this such a subtle gesture that we don't all
necessarily notice immediately?

PIP
Potentially, that's, that's up to you guys. It's just, I'm only trying to get Vera's
attention.

LYDIA
Hmm.

MADDY
Yeah, Vera definitely spots you and says like:

54

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh! Great! Um, yeah. Lovely to meet you, I'm Vera.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Er, Joseph.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Great, yeah, why don't you come on over and let's er, why don't we actually
take this to the HQ so we can speak freely? Um, just follow me.

MADDY
And she leads you all out of the coffee shop. [SFX: Door opens, bell jingles]

AHMED
I finish whatever rest of my cup-

MADDY
[laughs]

AHMED
-and just leave it so I don't take it with me! [laughs]

MADDY
Yeah!

55

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA
I've still got two drinks because I ordered a coffee and then, and then Adeeb
ordered me a hot chocolate so…um.

(Group laughter)

LOWRI
You can mix it and make a mocha!

PIP
Oh hell yeah.

LYDIA
Yeah, Mini's gonna walk out carrying both coffee mugs.

(Group laughter)

MADDY
Yeah, the man behind the bar's gonna be like:

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Um, excuse me, but-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh, yes?
56

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Um-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Could I have these to go?

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Yes, I will need to pour them into different cups.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh, right, OK.

MADDY (as THE ETERNAL TAVERN KEEPER)
Sorry.

MADDY
Yeah, and Vera kinds of waits patiently for this transaction to happen. [SFX:
Pouring]

LYDIA
While, while he's doing that, Mini will take notes about this interaction. And is
like - ooh, yeah. [SFX: Writing]

57

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
"Cannot take mugs out of coffee shop."

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
It's useful to know because they're the same mugs everywhere so you would
think that they were interchangeable.

LOWRI
Mm.

LYDIA
Turns out they're-

PIP
Well given how overpriced I'm assuming the coffee was you'd be safe to
assume-

LYDIA
Yeah, I thought it came with a free mug!

PIP
-you were also buying the mug!

58

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Right? Makes sense, makes sense. But you know.

MADDY
Absolutely.

LYDIA
Learn a new thing every day.

MADDY
Absolutely. And as you make your way out of the coffee shop following Vera
to your new career, we shall take a short break and will be right back. [SFX:
Door closes; Outside Tip Top Coffee Shop]

- [BREAK] -

[SFX: City Street]

MADDY
And we're back. So Vera leads you across the street down a couple of smaller
alleyways and you find yourself in front of this chrome glass monstrosity. It is
the most modern version of brutalism you've ever seen. It is both intimidating
and interesting to look at, and she takes her lanyard and passes it in front of
card reader and the doors swing open. [SFX: Beep, door opens; TARGE Lobby
59

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
interior, people talking quietly, gentle piano] As you're looking at the
entrance there's absolutely no signage whatsoever, it is completely blank.
Nothing to indicate what it is. And then as soon as you enter you're like - ah!
[SFX: Door closes] This is, this is where all the branding is. There are like
massive letters saying "TARGE" behind the reception desk, there are these
really moody like Hollywood black and white head shots of superheroes just all
through the lobby.

LYDIA
Oooh…
MADDY
And as you would know the superheroes of Chapter are kind of categorised
into generations, the oldest one being golden, then silver, then bronze and
modern. And TARGE is very proud of its long history of working with
superheroes, so you can see one of the golden age superheroes, the
Tremendous Titan who was a huge woman with fists made of rock-

LOWRI
[gasps]

MADDY
-and she was probably active in like the 50s or 60s.

LYDIA
For reference, what date are we in?

60

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
Um, present day.

LYDIA
Right, OK.

MADDY
You can also see one of the silver age superheroes, Brilliance, who is exuding a
bright, shimmering light. The bronze age superhero, who are those ones who
were born in the 70s and 80s, this is Chanteur who is a lithe man in the middle
of singing with pulses of energy just shooting out from his mouth. And then
there's one from the modern generation so people born in the 90s and later,
this is a very young person with short cropped hair whose hand is just reaching
inside a computer screen as though it's permeable, and you would all know
that this is one of the hottest new superheroes, Upgrade.

And so Vera takes you over to a set of very angular sofas and armchairs in the
corner of the lobby.

LOWRI
Can I ask, is there anyone else that we might recognise who would have their
photo up on that hall?

MADDY
Um…

61

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
Any familiar silhouettes?

MADDY
Not any that are relevant to your back stories necessarily. [laughs]

LOWRI
OK! Then Morgan just is like looking round, quite content.

MADDY
Yeah. This is the, this is very much just the kind of general famous popular
superheroes that everyone would know.

LOWRI and PIP
Mm-hm.

MADDY
And so Vera takes you over to this little corner of the lobby with some very
uncomfortable-looking armchairs and sofas and sits you all down [SFX:
Furniture squeaks] and she looks as you all and says:

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Right, so um, I think some introductions are in order now that we don't
necessarily have to be as secretive as we are out in public. So Joseph, why

62

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
don’t you tell us a little bit about yourself, what kind of abilities you have, how
you think you can help TARGE in the, in the superhero industry.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
[sighs] Um…

PIP
I just kind of stare at these people like this is, this is my nightmare!

LOWRI
Aw!

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Um, er, Joseph and er I -

PIP
And I'm sort of trying to vaguely avoid eye contact with, with Morgan a little
bit in this moment, but.

LOWRI
I mean she's looking at you quite intently.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
I go by, er, "Zenith". I'm very well-trained and I don't think you would have
contacted me if you didn't think I could help.
63

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Of course, yeah.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
I'm fairly certain you already know what I can do.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yes, absolutely. Um, just for the benefit of your team mates would you be able
to explain a little.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Like I said I'm, I'm well-trained.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Do you have any weapon specialties?

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Er, stealth, infiltration, surveillance, hand-to-hand combat.

LOWRI
Would you have given your name, Zenith, when you came to the library?

PIP
Er, yeah. Maybe.
64

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LOWRI
I guess, oh actually we would know, the public knows who Zenith is-

PIP
Yeah, Zenith has, Zenith, yes. He's not a very public-facing superhero-

LOWRI
Yeah..

PIP
-but it has come up. So, so yeah. That would be, that would be er, that's why
he's not looking at you.

LOWRI
Then Morgan is just gonna be like:

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I know you!

LOWRI
Overjoyed!

(Group laughter)

65

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

AHMED
Same thing from Adeeb. But he doesn't do anything he's just, his face is like it's you!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
You, you came, you came to our house!

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Er, yeah.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Did you tell them about me, is that how they know about me?

PIP (as JOSEPH)
No, I - no. No, I didn't say, I didn't tell anyone anything. That's, that's against
the rules.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
[quietly] Cool.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Um, can I ask who makes the rules?

66

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
[laughs]

PIP (as JOSEPH)
What?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Just you said "against the rules" and you know, I'm just interested in, in
learning who makes the rules.

PIP (as JOSEPH)
I just… I just meant you don't give away other people's secrets.

LYDIA (as MINI)
OK, and that's a rule?

PIP (as JOSEPH)
Su- sure.

LYDIA (as MINI)
OK!

LOWRI
I can see the pen and paper in your hand, like in my mind!

67

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Ironically I'm the one taking the least notes from what I can see on the camera
screen!

(Group laughter)

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Um great, yes, good to know. And Morgan, how about you? What's your
speciality? Do you have a hero name yet?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um, a hero? Well no, I mean I'm not… er. I don't think I'm a her-… er, so I'm,
I'm strong.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Good, yes.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Always useful.

68

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Really strong. And can get more strong.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yes. I obviously don't want to reveal anything that you'd be uncomfortable
with but I do feel like trust among your team-mates is an important thing to
foster this early in the relationship so if you could offer a bit more of an
explanation of how you get stronger then that would be very helpful.

LOWRI
OK. Are there - are there any plants around?

MADDY
Yes, there are some very sort of spiky looking succulents.

LOWRI
Hm. Presumably the furniture is nice and heavy? [laughs] For this?

MADDY
Yeah!

LOWRI
So Morgan will like just really really, just bend down, really easily just like lift
the sofa that two people are sitting on, like one side of it. [SFX: Lifting sofa]
69

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ooh!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Er-!

LYDIA
[laughs] I think, yeah, Adeeb and Mini would have been sitting on the same
sofa and like just been lifted up like:

(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ooh! Interesting! Ooh!

LOWRI
But only one side at this point. And then will touch one of the succulents,
which will lose its colour a little bit [SFX: Draining succulent] and then she will
just so easily just lift the sofa completely above her head, yeah, one-handed.
[SFX: Lifting couch]

LYDIA (as MINI)
Whoah!

70

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED (as ADEEB)
OK! So this is how it feels to ride a camel!

LYDIA (as MINI)
Ah! That's really amazing!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh just, just-

LOWRI
No strain in her voice at all.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
-oh um, I've never ridden a camel. But, yeah!

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Oh yeah, my grandfather has one. And I don't wanna go on it, so-!

(Group laughter)

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Oh! Sorry!

71

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI
And then she'll just put you down a little bit hurriedly, jolts you a bit. [SFX:
Sharp thud]

AHMED (as ADEEB)
OK, thank you!

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah so um, yeah. I can take energy from living things.

LYDIA (as MINI)
ALL living things…?

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yeah but I don't really like to - I mean people it's a bit you know-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yeah.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
It's a bit trickier. Um. Well it's not trickier it's um, it's just more complicated.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Well thank you for sharing that, that's very good information to have. And so
Mini.
72

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA (as MINI)
Mm-hm?

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
How about you?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, I am a journalist and I sell shoes.

AHMED
[laughs]

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yes. Er, from your background check those are both true.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Mm-hm.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
But I'm looking for more… superheroic elements that are the reason that we
brought you in.

73

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
Um… well I, you know, I don't like to make, you know I don't, I don't like to
make that big a, a thing of it, but like, um…

LYDIA
And Mini will reach out to the succulent that has lost some of its colour and
will like manipulate - like, she can control matter but like, exactly how is kind of
blurry. So like, she just sort of elongates it. So it's not like it's growing but it's
like sort of, as if it were putty or clay, like, summons it to grow a bit longer.
[SFX: Succulent stretching] And like, you know there's just like small things
and with the other hand just somehow alters the way that the light is coming
through the window [SFX: Ethereal chimes] so that they seem to kind of, the
rays gather and glitter in her hand, and then sort of, as if her hand were a
mirror then kind of shoots it off like a, like a laser. [SFX: Shooting light,
whoosh]

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
[gasps]

LYDIA (as MINI)
You know, just like normal things.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
Like, but it's not really, it's not, it's not really that worth mentioning. Mm-hm.
74

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LOWRI
Does it hit anything?

LYDIA
Possibly…

AHMED
[laughs]

MADDY
What we could is an "Unleash Your Powers" roll and see what happens?

LOWRI
Oh!

PIP
Yeahhh! Dice! Dice! Dice!

LYDIA
So for the benefit of listeners, not for me that hasn't forgotten, I roll two D6s,
right?

MADDY
Yes. Two D6 and add your Freak Stat.
75

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

LYDIA
OK.

PIP
I'm guessing that's pretty low for you, right?

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
(ROLL) 7 and, it's like plus 1, you know so that's an 8. It's like yeah, because
yeah, totally a normal human.

MADDY
So yes, it absolutely does work but unfortunately as you direct this beam of
light it catches a bit of paper on the receptionist's desk and it just starts to
smoke and catch fire. [SFX: Paper catches fire]

LYDIA (as MINI)
Um… give me a second!

LYDIA
Mini runs over and-

76

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
[starts trying to blow the flames out]

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Trying to just blow the fire out but it does actually just add-

LOWRI
Oxygen! [laughs]

LYDIA
Yeah, it just adds oxygen and it gets worse and eventually Mini is standing on
the desk stamping it out. [SFX: Fire worsens; stamping on desk]

(Group laughter)

MADDY
The receptionist reaches behind and grabs like a massive fire extinguisher and
just [makes whooshing sound]. Just absolutely sprays it into oblivion. [SFX:
Fire extinguisher]

AHMED
[laughs]

77

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY
And is just like-

MADDY (as RECEPTIONIST)
It's, it's all right, these things happen all the time, honestly.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Oh, right, sure, yeah. Because I, like it's just a normal thing.

LYDIA
Mini hops down onto the ground and walks back. [SFX: Gentle thud]

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yeah but like er my real interests are er investigative journalism, um, and
hitting my targets at the shoes shop.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Great!

LOWRI
Oh! I love Mini so much! [laughs]

(Group laughter)

78

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Well good to know. Actually investigative skills are useful in this line of work

LYDIA (as MINI)
Mm-hm.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
so that will put you in good stead. I'm not sure about the shoes but any
experience is good I suppose.

LYDIA (as MINI)
From what I've heard and working with Adeeb, er, you're gonna need a lot of
high-quality shoes.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
[clears his throat loudly]

(Group laughter)

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh, yes, all right. Um yeah, Adeeb.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yes?

79

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
What can you tell us about your, your abilities?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
I can control textiles. Like anything that is threaded or woven.

AHMED
And you see from my backpack a white ribbon starts to float and then starts
wrapping around my arms. [SFX: Fabric manipulation]

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Wow!

LYDIA (as MINI)
This actually makes a lot of sense.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Having seen you go into changing rooms and like come out in a completely
different outfit when you didn't take those clothes in.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Er, you noticed.

80

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yeah…

AHMED (as ADEEB)
But I can't control stuff like leather because it's just one piece of something it's
not threaded or woven at all.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Right, yeah. That makes sense. And I understand that you've been active
already as a, as a hero?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yes. I've been, like I'm not really active just like doing one specific thing, I'm
tracking one person. So not much. But if anything happens along the way, I
mean I'm gonna stop and help.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh, um, one specific thing. Would you be able to share anything about that?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Well I'm trying to help one villain just to stop and go, you know, stop being a
bad guy. And I've been trying to chase after him for a while. But if it just
happens along the way I'm trying to track him something happens, I help, but…

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh right, OK. I take it there's some kind of personal reason there?

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yeah. He needs help. It's - he just needs help.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
I understand, yeah. It can be difficult when personal relationships intermingle
with this kind of work and I commend you for trying to help, but I also caution
you that mixing these worlds can get complicated.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yeah I, I understand but like come on, if the Police catch him he's gonna go to
prison, nobody's gonna try to help him out and he's gonna just rot in jail, like if
I can reach him before that and try to pull him out of it and stop and go in the
right path, you know, it's better.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Yes, yes it is. People should be helped, people shouldn't just be left to, you
know.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Yeah.

82

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Whatever.

LOWRI
Morgan retreats a bit into herself, she's said a bit too much.

LYDIA
So - Mini's got her pen out.

LYDIA (as MINI)
So imprisoned people just rot, is that-?

(Group laughter)

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
I believe that that was metaphorical.

LYDIA (as MINI)
So they metaphorically rot. That, that is also bad. OK, thank you.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yeah, the prison industrial complex is really a massive issue that we can't get
into right now, er-

83

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
LYDIA (as MINI)
OK.

(Group laughter)

LYDIA
Keeps taking notes…

(Group laughter)

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
All right, so er-

AHMED
Oh er, I'm - I pull out my mask and put it on and – [SFX: Pulling out mask]

AHMED (as ADEEB)
I'm The Turban.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
I've seen you!

LYDIA (as MINI)
That, that, that does make a lot of sense!

84

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
AHMED
And I hold up the blue turban that I put on my head.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Really I didn't, I didn't put two and two together. Really I should have. Should
have got there.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
You um, you did a great job against those er, those burglars last week. Well
done.

AHMED (as ADEEB)
Ah, thank you. If it wasn't for the collateral damage… [voice tails off] [clears
throat] Yeah I, I did my best.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, is this a team that is trying to fix the prison industrial complex or are we
doing the rescuing people thing or like, what are the, what are your aims and
objectives?

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Yes, so, that is a very good question. You will be starting off on the more um,
on the more low-pressure missions. There are some kind of lower level
supervillains that we may need some help with managing and containing. We
may need some help with civilians who get into dangerous situations and need
85

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
a hand. In general, going on a variety of different missions including, er,
neutralising supervillain threats, doing reconnaissance, doing rescue missions,
all that kind of thing. Sometimes you'll be ask to retrieve something that is
important to the government's goals. And yeah, in general it's about keeping
people safe and er, looking at your background checks and everything it looks
like you're already well on your way to do that so, welcome to the team.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
Um, will there be, like, er, training? I mean I, I, you know, obviously I've
trained myself but like, this is very new to me, I've never done actual hero-ing
before.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Oh yeah, absolutely there will be plenty of opportunity for training. We have
incredible training facilities here at HQ both for combat and investigation,
reconnaissance, rescue, emergency situations, all that kind of stuff, so.

LOWRI (as MORGAN)
And do we get like a say in what we're tackling, like who, like what missions we
take or-?

LYDIA (as MINI)
Yeah, for instance I would actually quite like to get to the heart of this prison
industrial complex issue because that sounds like a really good place to start,
like, maybe we could look at funding that instead of sending people to jail?

86

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop
(Group laughter)

LYDIA (as MINI)
Er, in a way that everyone accepts is not gonna help them?

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Well that is a very noble goal-

LYDIA (as MINI)
Mm-hm.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
And I applaud you for that but really we are focused on supervillains and
threats that can only be dealt with by people with super abilities.

LYDIA (as MINI)
I see. Interesting.

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
Er, perhaps it will come up? I can't promise that.

LYDIA (as MINI)
Mm-hm.

(Group laughter)
87

CHAP Masks 2 – Tip Top Coffee Shop

MADDY (as VERA CONSTANTINE)
We'll have to see. But yes, you are very welcome to take advantage of our
training facilities, and actually before we do anything else I would very much
like to take you to our warehouse.

MADDY
And she gets you all up [SFX: Standing] and starts leading you down this
corridor towards, towards these massive metal doors and she presses a button
and they slide open. [SFX: Corridor interior; pressing button, doors sliding
open] And as you look down this huge cavernous room there are just shelves
and shelves of weapons, costumes, devices, gadgets, just every single resource
you could possibly need is there.

And that's where we're gonna end the episode for today. Thank you so much
for listening to this episode of Chapter and Multiverse, I would now like to ask
our fantastic players where we can find you on the internet and if you have
anything to plug, starting with Lydia.
