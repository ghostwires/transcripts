ANNOUNCER
This episode is dedicated to Talia
Lindner - This is dedicated to my
friends and family for listening to me
talk about the Magnus Archives for
far longer than could be considered
reasonable. I apologize in advance
for what Magnus Protocol will do to
me. You are the real heroes.

Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus
Protocol.
Episode Ten – Saturday Night
[Music]

1. INT. MORNING PROGRAM TV STUDIO- DAY, CLEAR (CASE
FILE – TV INTERVIEW)
The strains of “Mr. Bonzo’s on his Way” fade away as the host
GERALDINE HARDY can be heard laughing.
GERALDINE
Now, I’m sure I don’t need to tell
anyone what that little blast of 90s
nostalgia was. “Mr. Bonzo’s On His
Way” which topped charts for over
eleven weeksNIGEL
(jokingly)
Twelve.

GERALDINE
Twelve weeks, smashing the record
for TV tie-in music and launching a
merchandise empire. Well, Today I’m
here with the creator of Mr. Bonzo
and former host of “Saturday on
Six”, Nigel Dickerson.
NIGEL
It’s an absolute pleasure to be here
Geraldine. Nice to be on TV again.
GERALDINE
It has been a while, hasn’t it?
NIGEL
I’ve kept busy.
GERALDINE
So, twenty-five years since Mr.
Bonzo’s debut. Why don’t you tell us
a little bit about how it all started?
NIGEL
(with odd energy)
I mean, it started as a joke…
Beat.
NIGEL
Channel Six approached me in
ninety-four to be the host and
frontman of their Saturday night
variety show. It was a risky move
back then of course – Channel Six
had only existed for a year and I
wasn’t exactly a household name. I
mean, I was part of the BBC’s family
programming, but I was hardly top of
anyone’s list.

[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Still, “Nigel Dickerson presents
Saturdays on Six” or “Nigel’s SOS”
as they started calling it, really took
off. I mean, at the end of the day it
was still the same sort of variety
show that BBC and ITV were running
on Saturday primetime: skits, music,
interviews, some on-location
features. What marked us out though
was that we didn’t take ourselves
nearly as seriously as them. The
whole conceit was that the set was
built like an enormous comedy
dungeon, and I’d been imprisoned by
“Mr. Six.”
GERALDINE
Mr. Six?
NIGEL
Oh, he was our fictional head of
Channel Six and I had to do a good
show so I’d be released.
GERALDINE
(laughing, playing along)
Oh of course.
NIGEL
We had a lot of fun with it. At the top
of each show I’d get a phone call
from Mr. Six, who was always very
angry, and he’s say he’d gotten a
complaint from some busybody
writing in with a name like Mrs.
Sourpucker or Mr. Smallprick, and
then I’d be told I had to do the whole
show without… I don’t know, using
the words “up next” or standing on
one leg or something and people
loved it. They really loved it.
[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GERALDINE
And where did Mr. Bonzo come into
it?
NIGEL
(slight energy change)
Yes. Mr. Bonzo. Of course. Well, one
of our big things was pranks. We had
a whole section called “You Got
Berried!” where we’d invite on some
serious public figure and make them
look a bit silly, like, uh, get a famous
footballer to do a bunch of kick-ups
but we’d weighted the ball, and at the
end I’d come out, say “You Got
Berried!” and give them this big
golden raspberry trophy. It was all in
fun, of course. No guests were hurt.
So, one day, my producer, Rich, had
this fantastic idea. We do the whole
schtick of inviting a famous person
on, someone really serious, and we
tell them we’re going to have them
do a segment with a popular
children’s entertainer. Now,
obviously these folks won’t have any
idea about what kids are actually
watching, so we could come up with
the most horrendous thing, claim
kids loved it and see how long it took
for the guest to realize that they were
the joke. That they’d been “berried”.
So I came up with this awful clown
character – this big bulbous,
splotchy suit, running around,
screaming his own name and
generally being a nightmare.

[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GERALDINE
Who came up with the name “Mr.
Bonzo”?
NIGEL
You know, I honestly don’t
remember. I know it wasn’t me or
Rich, but at some point someone
said it and the name just stuck. I
don’t really know what else to say
about it. His name is Mr. Bonzo.
I remember the first show we used
him. We’d invited Gotard Rimbaeu –
the chef. He was very big at the time.
Lots of TV appearances, a cooking
column in The Times. But I think he
was looking to soften his public
image after the Mirror ran a story on
him, I don’t quite remember…
GERALDINE
“BRITAIN’S SNOOTIEST CHEF”
NIGEL
That was it. Yeah, after that he
agreed to do a segment on our show
teaching children how to cook. He’s
obviously never seen the show and
was completely oblivious to kids’
culture. He was absolutely perfect.
When Mr Bonzo emerged out of the
pantry, the effect was… incredible.
Rimbeau’s face went white and he
looked like he was about to scream.
I’ll be honest, I’d seen the suit
already, but I hadn’t seen it moving,
and it was even freaking me out a bit.
Rimbeau tried to keep it together, as
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

far as he knew all the kids did love
Mr. Bonzo, but when that big rubbery
clown started knocking over pans
and smashing eggs all over the
studio kitchen, “the snooty chef”
actually tried to hide behind a
shelving unit. And finally, when Mr
Bonzo went in for a cuddle, Rimbeau
genuinely attacked him with a frying
pan. He actually broke the arm of the
guy wearing him, which I took as my
cue to enter with the Golden Berry.
This was on live TV don’t forget.
GERALDINE
Sounds like a disaster!
NIGEL
I thought so too. But according to
our audience it was the best thing
we’d ever done. Over the next week
we got literally hundreds of letters
demanding more Mr. Bonzo.
GERALDINE
Even with a broken arm?
NIGEL
Well, there was a different man in the
suit, of course. There were a few of
them over the years. It was very
physically demanding and that
wasn’t the only injury we had with it.
It actually became a sort of ritual: the
newest member of the production
crew wore Mr. Bonzo until someone
else joined.
GERALDINE
Or until they got hit by a pan!
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

She laughs. Nigel doesn’t.
NIGEL
Ha. Yes. Of course, the joke couldn’t
last. The problem with a surprise
prank is that doing it on Saturday
night primetime means pretty soon
everyone knows about it, and the
guests knew it was coming. A couple
even requested it. So the prank part
of it sort of died, and he just became
an SOS mascot. One of my many
tormentors in the dungeon. By the
end we’d even retired Mr. Six, and it
was all Bonzo.
GERALDINE
Clearly it was the right decision.
NIGEL
The kids certainly liked him. It turned
out they really did think he was
hilarious. Well, the ones who didn’t
wet themselves, anyway.
Gerladine laughs
NIGEL
(cont.)
There was a pretty stark dividing line
between the two. Soon it was
Bonzomania: merch sales were
through the roof; “underserving
number one hit single” actually did
become a number one hit single and
we even started construction on a
small Bonzoland theme park at one
point. It was… It was a good time.

[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GERALDINE
(tonal shift)
And thenNIGEL
And then we all know what
happened. People… stopped liking
Mr. Bonzo.
GERALDINE
If you don’t feel comfortable
discussing Terrance Menki, we could
move on toNIGEL
No, it’s fine. You know it was only
the last one, right? The one where he
was caught? The police said there
were eleven bodies in total and his
wardrobe was full of all sorts of
homemade costumes. Who knows
what he wore for the rest? But no,
because he was caught dressed as
Mr. Bonzo, that’s all people
remember, the, uh, theGERALDINE
The “Bonzo Butcher”.
NIGEL
The Bonzo Butcher! Ridiculous
tabloid garbage. It didn’t even look
like him! He got the colors
backwards! But they still splashed
the image all over the front page.
Complete overreaction.
GERALDINE
An overreaction?

[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

NIGEL
No, I mean, uh, it was inappropriate.
To show to the public I mean.
GERALDINE
It certainly had a profound effect on
the Mr. Bonzo brand.
NIGEL
Bonzoland halted construction
shortly afterwards and the suits
decided it was best to “temporarily”
halt production on SOS.
GERALDINE
And how about you personally?
NIGEL
Well of course I got death threats.
We had nothing to do with it
obviously, but people can be very
stupid about this sort of thing.
Anyway, that was that – in the minds
of the public, Mr. Bonzo had been
completely changed.
Beat.
NIGEL
(cont.)
I’m given to understand he’s still got
some fans. In the, uh, edgier parts of
the internet. As a “meme”.
GERALDINE
Yes, I was going to ask –Mr. Bonzo
merchandise is still on sale via your
own website. Do you feel at all
uneasy about that?

[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

NIGEL
About what? The fact that a few
sales might be from people trying to
be edgy? A man’s got to make a
living, Geraldine, and it’s not like I
can tell if someone’s buying a t-shirt
ironically. Besides, people think of
Nigel Dickerson and Mr. Bonzo is
never far behind so it’s not like its
changing my reputation. In a lot of
ways I’m more his prisoner now than
I ever was on my show.
GERALDINE
And how do you respond to the more
recent rumours?
NIGEL
(on guard)
Excuse me?
GERALDINE
The witness statements from three
murders over the last five yearsNIGEL
(speaking over her)
I told your producer this wasn’t
going to be discussed.
GERALDINE
-that claim a person in a Mr. Bonzo
costume was at the scene? Do you
think there could be a copycat?
NIGEL
(Getting up)
This interview is over. Don’t contact
us again.
GERALDINE
Us?
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

NIGEL
(losing it)
It was a joke alright!? Mr. Bonzo was
meant to be funny, make people
laugh! Is that so wrong? Why am I
still trapped dealing with all thisthis- Why won’t he let me go?! WhyThe recording abruptly cuts out.
2. INT. OIAR OFFICES - NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER).
CELIA finishes listening to the Case. She types it up and files it
with a double click and 8-bit fanfare. She sighs, then gets up
from her chair and walks over to the breakroom. The empty
office is noticeably silent.
Silence.
The office door opens and COLIN enters. He looks around for a
second.
COLIN
Hello?
CELIA
(from the breakroom)
Colin?
She comes back into the room.
COLIN
Sorry, don’t let me interrupt.
CELIA
It’s fine, just stuck the kettle on. You
want a cup?
COLIN
No thanks. I’m cutting back on
caffeine…
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
Celia.
COLIN
Celia. Right. Sorry.
CELIA
No problem – I’m still new.
COLIN
Where is everyone?
CELIA
Gwen’s on “assignment”, whatever
that means. Alice and Sam are, uh,
following up something from a case.
COLIN
(distracted)
Right. Shame. Wanted Alice’s
thoughts on something. You know
anything about computers?
CELIA
Not really. Weren’t you on leave?
COLIN
For my brain, yeah. Didn’t work.
Talked to three therapists. None of
them even knew what a logic gate is.
What the hell use is that going to be?
CELIA
I don’t know
COLIN
None. I was just sat their twiddling
my thumbs. Best thing for me is
figuring this out.

[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
(unconvinced)
Right.
COLIN
So the other’s are all gone out right?
CELIA
Yeah, butCOLIN
Great. That’ll make things easier.
He sits at a desk and starts booting it up.
COLIN
(cont.)
Maybe don’t tell them I’ve been on
their terminals. They’ll only get the
wrong idea.
CELIA
Uh, sure.
Colin starts typing on the PC a little breathless.
Beat.
CELIA
Cool. Well, I think that was the kettle,
so I’ll probably leave you to it.
COLIN
Yeah. Oh, and, uh, Celia?
CELIA
Mm?
COLIN
If Lena asks, I wasn’t here.
He starts to pull open the active computer, muttering to himself
while Celia walks off to the breakroom.
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
…sure.
3. EXT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE RUINS – NIGHT, STARTING TO
RAIN (SAM’S PHONE)
SAM and ALICE pick their way gingerly through the burned and
collapsed skeleton of the Magnus Institute. ALICE is under an
umbrella. Her foot almost goes through a rotten floorboard and
SAM grabs her.
SAM
Careful.
ALICE
Yeah, well, that’d be easier if I wasn’t
digging through a crumbling, rotten
ruin in the rain.
SAM
And it’d be even easier if you
stopped moaning and got on with
actually looking around you.
ALICE
Touché. Although I’ll point out I still
don’t haven’t any idea what we’re
even looking for. Is it bad vibes?
Because I think I have found them.
She lifts up some rotten planking.
ALICE
Oh, no. False alarm. Just a dead rat.
Lovely.
She drops the plank.
SAM
I’ll know it when I see it.

[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Will you? Because that sounds very
suspiciously, like the kind of line
someone says when they don’t know
what they’re looking for. I honestly
don’t know what you expect. It’s a
ruin. Burned wood, collapsed rooms,
rubble. It’s not exactly a treasure
trove.
SAM
If you’re that bothered you can head
home. Don’t let me keep you.
ALICE
Sam, there is honestly nowhere I’d
rather be than here with you. And to
be clear, I mean that in a profoundly
depressing way. Like, it’s Saturday
night and I’m choosing to hang out
in a hole with you. A wet hole. And
not the good kind either.
SAM
Well, thanks then I guess.
ALICE
Well, you’re welcome then I guessSAM
Hang on, what was that?
ALICE
(suddenly interested
despite herself)
WhatSAM
Turn back, shine your light over…
Yes!

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

He clambers over some broken furniture and starts wrestling
with a rusty old filing cabinet.
ALICE
Wait are you serious? We’re getting
excited over that. It’ll be empty. And
even if it isn’t its rusted shutSAM
(straining pathetically)
Which means I should be able to
break the lock…
ALICE
And find a peer-reviewed paper on
all the tetanus you’re going to get.
Your gonna cut yourself up for
mulch The filing cabinet opens slightly with a grinding sound.
SAM
Got it!
He looks inside.
ALICE
So? Any life changing revelations?
Or…
SAM
(disappointed)
MulchALICE
(enjoying herself)
Mulch, that’s right.
SAM
Dammit!
He kicks the filing cabinet. It clearly hurts.
[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
You all right?
SAM
I’m fine!
Beat
SAM
(con.t)
Ow.
ALICE
Look, Sam, you asked me to come
and I came. I’m sorry that this isn’t
the closure or whatever it was you
were searching for but I think you’re
wasting your time. We’re just lucky
this place hasn’t already collapsed
on us.
SAM
I don’t feel lucky.
ALICE
That makes two of us. Look I get it,
okay? It has some weird bits I’ll
grant you. That carved floor in the
big atrium – I don’t know what’s
going on with that. But whatever
ghosts you’re hoping to bust? I don’t
think they’re here.
Beat.
ALICE
Sam.
SAM
Fine! Fine let’s…
He starts rummaging in the filing cabinet.
[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Seriously? I literally just talked you
into leaving, please don’t now tell me
you’ve actually found something
thatSAM
(Yanking his hand out)
Aha!
ALICE
(wearily)
It’s a key.
SAM
Oh yeah. And you know what that
means?
ALICE
Someone’s gym bag is getting really
grim trapped in a locker somewhere?
SAM
(beseechingly)
Alice.
ALICE
(Wearily good natured)
Eurgh. Fine. 10 more minutes. And
I’m keeping the umbrella.
4. INT. NIGEL DICKERSON’S MANSION. NIGHT, RAINING (TV)
The TV flicks on. There is a beat, then the doorbell rings. NIGEL
shuffles down the stairs as the doorbell rings again.
NIGEL
(to himself)
Alright, I’m coming…

[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

He unbolts the door. There’s a lot of them. Then he opens the
heavy wooden doors to find GWEN stood in the porch.
NIGEL
What?
GWEN
(checking papers)
Uh- Nigel Dickerson?
NIGEL
Do you know what time it is?
GWEN
I’m here on behalf of the Office of
Incident Assessment and Response.
NIGEL
Oh?
A realization dawns on him.
GWEN
I have a message for you. I was told
to deliver it personally. Here.
She tries to hand him the envelope. He does not take it.
NIGEL
I can’t.
GWEN
My instructions were very clear. Go
to the home of Nigel Dickerson and
hand over this envelope.
NIGEL
It’s not for me.
Beat. A Sigh.
Come in. And wipe your feet.
[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GWEN does so, closing the door behind her. NIGEL sighs then
walks over and turns on an old hi-fi. “Mr Bonzo’s on his Way”
starts playing
NIGEL
I’m sorry about this
GWEN
Uhh…what?
NIGEL turns the music up.

There is a wet, lumbering step on the staircase. Something is
dragging itself down the stairs to meet them.

GWEN
What is- Who…?
NIGEL
Try not to stare. He doesn’t like it
when people stare.

MR BONZO drags himself into view.

GWEN
(horrified)
Oh my god!
MR BONZO
B-B-B-Bonzo Bonzo Bonzo!
NIGEL
Mr Bonzo meet… I didn’t actually get
your name. Probably for the best.

[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

MR BONZO
BONZO BONZO BONZO!!!
NIGEL
(urgently)
I said don’t stare!
Gwen does not reply. It is clear she is trying not to
hyperventilate.
NIGEL
(To Bonzo, wearily)
Looks like they’ve got another one
for you.
(To Gwen)
Give it to him.
MR BONZO
BONZO!
GWEN
I… what?
Mr Bonzo is becoming agitated.
MR BONZO
BONZO! BONZO!
NIGEL
The name, the address – tell him
where to go.
GWEN
What? I don’t- No one told me
anything. Who’s in there?
MR BONZO
(growing angry)
BOOONZOOO!

[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

NIGEL
(starting to panic)
What are you talking about? The
envelope, just give him the envelope!
GWEN
C-can he read?
NIGEL
Just do it!

Gwen holds out the envelope and Mr Bonzo snatches it into his
mouth, audibly chewing it. His teeth are not soft.

MR BONZO
BONZO!! BONZO BONZO BONZO!

Mr. Bonzo excitedly lumbers away, violently throwing open the
door and lumbering off into the night.

NIGEL
(panting with relief)
Oh thank god. That nearly went very
badly.
GWEN
I… I don’tNIGEL
Tell the people who sent you “you’re
welcome. Again.”
GWEN
Ah- okay?

[23]

©Rusty Quill 2023

NIGEL
Now get out of his house.

5. EXT. THE MAGNUS INSTITUTE RUINS – NIGHT,
THUNDERSTORM (TAPE RECORDER)
Somewhere in a dark abandoned office a tape recorder clicks
on. The sounds of a thunderstorm, muffled by several walls, is
punctuated by a close trickle and distant drips. The door to the
office rattles, as someone tries to open it. SAM and ALICE can
be heard through the rotten wood.
SAM
(muffled)
You literally just saw me try.
ALICE
(muffled)
I believed you couldn’t open it.
That’s not the same as being locked.
SAM
(muffled, wearisome)
Here we go again with the ickle, baby
shrimp Sam routine.
ALICE
(muffled)
A) I have never called you a baby
shrimp but thanks for the idea.
B) Shut up and try the key.
SAM tries the key in the lock. It does not turn.
ALICE
(muffled. Cont.)
Well, we tried. Come on.

[24]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
(muffled)
Hang on, the wood here’s pretty
rotten. I think…
With a wet crack, the wood around the lock breaks and it
collapses inwards with SAM tangled in it.
SAM
Ha! Suck it!
ALICE
That really hurt didn’t it?
Beat. SAM shifts in the sharp woodpile.
SAM
Maybe.
ALICE
C’mere.
She helps him up and they pick rotten wood off him.
ALICE
(cont.)
So much for your key.
SAM
We’re here aren’t we?
ALICE
And where is here exactly?
SAM
Someone’s office, I guess? Looks
like it held up better than the rest…
ALICE
(picking something up)
Who do you reckon Archie was?

[25]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Huh?
ALICE
I found one of those old timey name
block things.
SAM
Uh… Archipelago?
ALICE
I’m sorry what?
SAM
What?
ALICE
You’re just going to skip straight to
“Archipelago”? Not, I don’t know,
architect? Archive?
SAM
I mean, there are books I suppose...
He picks one up and it disintegrates in his hands.
SAM
(cont’d)
There were books, anyway.
ALICE
Nice chair. I could look real ominous
swiveling in that thing.
SAM
I wouldn’t risk it. Not unless you
want woodworms up your butt.
ALICE
Ew. That explains the pattern on the
floor.

[26]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Oh yeah… What is that?
ALICE
Worm tracks. Or y’know symbols of
ancient otherworldly power. One or
the other.
SAM
Look, you can be creeped out or
sarcastic but not both.
ALICE
Watch me.
SAM moves closer and the wooden floor creaks ominously.
ALICE
(cont.)
Careful…
SAM
(turning)
Oh thank goodness you said that
otherwise I would’ve jumped up and
down the dangerousThe floor breaks.
SAM
(falling)
Oh shi-!
ALICE catches him and pulls him back but not before he drops
his key with a distant splash. SAM gasps in relief.
SAM
I dropped the key!
ALICE
What was that? Because it sounded
a lot like, “I’m sorry Alice you were
right. We should head back now
[27]

©Rusty Quill 2023

before I get myself killed falling into
a soggy pit. Gosh you’re sexy, here’s
a twenty for your trouble.”
SAM
We can’t! This is the first clue we’ve
found!
ALICE
Clue? What clue!? It’s a hole Sam.
It’s a dark and manky hole in a dark
and manky office in a dark and
manky building riddled with bugs
and god knows what else. I’m sorry
but enough. This isn’t some grand
clue to your childhood. It’s a hole.
Time to go Sam.
Beat. Sam lets out a long, defeated breath.
ALICE
(cont’d)
I am sorry. I know you got your
hopes up.
SAM
No, you’re right. I don’t know what
I’m looking for. I have… I have
memories of weird stuff I saw here,
but no context. I want to know what
was happening, why they chose us…
why they didn’t choose me. Maybe
find the bit where everything started
to go wrong. But… it’s too late. And
now… I’m the only one left who
cares.
ALICE
I care.
Beat.
[28]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Not a lot mind, don’t flatter yourself.
But the truth is, closure’s for movies,
mate. All we get is manky holes.
Beat.
SAM
You know there’s a cream for that.
ALICE
(warmly)
There’s my baby shrimp.
SAM
(sighing)
Come on, let’s get out of here before
we fall into what I’m starting to think
might be a cesspit.
ALICE
Oh I thought that was you! I figured
you’d messed yourself when you fell.
SAM
Charming.
They start walking away from the tape recorder.
ALICE
I calls it as I smells it. Now, as fun as
it is being moments away from
getting our own creepy case, I could
really do with a drink. You think that
pub we passed is still open?
SAM
It's Manchester, so yeah, probably.
Whether they’ll serve us when we
smell like a dead fox is another
matter…
[29]

©Rusty Quill 2023

The voices finally disappear, lost to the distance and the rain.
There is a long silence as the tape keeps running. The water is
gently disturbed below. Then there is a thud on the hidden
wooden trapdoor and the rattle of a padlock.
There is the distinct sound of a key being dragged across wood
then being blindly fumbled in a lock which finally clicks.
The trap door opens, the lock falling away and [ERROR]
emerges and takes a shuddering breath..
Click.
