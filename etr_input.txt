CELIA is sat reading.
SAM enters, walks over, then plops into the seat opposite.

SAM
Ahem.
CELIA turns a page.
SAM CONT.
Uh- Ahem?
CELIA
One sec.
She notes something down.
SAM

Beat.
SAM
AhemCELIA
Oh my, Sam! I didn't see you there! What
can I do for you?
SAM
I’m so glad you asked Celia! I was
wondering if you had perhaps dropped
something…
CELIA
(amused but confused)
Don’t think so.
SAM
You’re sure? Nothing small and ticket
shaped like perhaps(flourishing)
These incredibly exclusive, hardlydiscounted, barely obstructed theatre
tickets?
CELIA
No.
Beat.
SAM
You’re sure? Because they look like they’d
be perfect for someone to use maybe for a
second date…
CELIA
Yea. Nothing to do with me.
Beat.
SAM
(earnest)
So… is that a no toCELIA
(smiling)
I'm just playing… What’s the show?
[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023
SAM
(checking ticket)
Oh, er… “The Pillowman”?
CELIA starts laughing.
SAM
What?
CELIA
(laughing)
Oh nothing, very romantic choice.
SAM
Is it? I don’t really know much about it, I
just thought…
CELIA
Well count me in. If only to see your face.
SAM
Cool. Sorted, then.
ALICE enters loudly and rushes over.
ALICE
Not so fast now!
SAM sighs quietly.
ALICE
I mean sure you could both go canoodle in
some stuffy old theatreSAM
It's a good place to canoodle.
ALICE
-or you could hear one of the great up-andcoming music sensations that is currently
taking the London scene by storm!
SAM
Let me guess, Dredgerman?

[4]

ALICE
Don’t be daft, they’re taking a break before
their tour! No, it’s “Penny for the Well”
actually.
SAM
But it is still Luke on Bass right? How
many bands is that boy in?
ALICE
Let’s just say that this revolutionary indie
ensemble, which may or may not also
include my incredibly talented younger
brother, is playing The Gladstone Arms at
ten thirty tomorrow evening and you are
both on the guest list. You’re welcome.
Beat.
CELIA
I’m sure Luke is great AliceALICE
Oh he isCELIA
-but I don't think I can make it.
SAM
Anyway, we’re going to the theatre.
ALICE
Aha! But that’s the best bit, they’re the last
ones on so you can do your boring play
and then just swing by afterwards!
SAM
AliceALICE
Oh come on, it's the weekend. Live a little!
CELIA
I’m sorry, but I don't think my sitter can
stay late.
[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023
Beat.
ALICE
Your… sitter?
CELIA
Yeah. There’s no one else to step in so…
it’s a thanks but no thanks from me.
Beat.
ALICE
No, yeah, no, of course. So… Like, a dog
sitter, or…?
CELIA
A baby. Human.
ALICE
(kind of thrown)
Right. Sorry. Yeah, that's cool. Babies are
cool.
CELIA stands and picks up her paperwork.
CELIA
I’ll tell you what though, give me a bit more
notice next time and I’ll see if I can’t sort
something. I’d love to see your brother
play.
ALICE
Uh yeah, sure.
CELIA
Anyhoo don’t mind me, I’m a bit behind
tonight.
(to Sam)
Just ping me the details for the theatre
later yeah?
SAM
‘course.
Celia exits.
Beat.

[6]

ALICE
So…
SAM
(standing)
And you say I’m clueless.
ALICE
What?
Sam exits.
ALICE CONT.
(calling)
What? I said babies were cool!

CUT TO:
INT. CAR - NIGHT, HEAVY RAIN (PHONE)
CATERER
(catching their breath)
I need to report… something. I can’t go to
the police, I- You’re supposed to be
independent and well, I’ve got to risk it.
People need to know. They need to know
what’s happening, what they’re doing, and
I don’t know how much time I’ve got left.
I work as a caterer. High-end private
functions, silver service, that kind of thing.
It’s my own company and I’ve managed to
build up a decent reputation in the right
circles.
We get called in for the really high-end
stuff. The kind of event where the guest list
is so rich that you’ve never even heard of
them. There’s a big difference between
“extravagance” and “elegance.” We sell
the latter.
We’re not a big operation though, there
were only six permanent staff including
myself. We do hire in fixed-term waiting
staff and other contractors but even so… I
knew these people. I worked with them for
years and they didn’t deserve what
happened to them…
We got the call a couple of months ago for
a fairly small event at Wychwood Hall in
the Cotswold’s. Apparently, they had a
family shoot and wanted us to prepare the
game. Normally that would be pheasant or
partridge and we’d just swap it for stuff we
prepared off-site since no one could ever
tell the difference, but they were really
explicit about it being larger game and
wanting to know who’s kill they were
eating.
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

That meant a lot more prep time and
equipment but they insisted and at this
level you don’t get to tell the client no, just
how much extra it will cost.
We set up the cooking gazebo during the
early afternoon in the rear gardens on the
butler’s instruction. The house itself was a
massive sprawling Elizabethan thing with
pristine flowerbeds and prim lawns that ran
right up to the surrounding woodland. It
wasn’t usual to be given center stage like
that but I figured the client fancied
themself a foodie and wanted to see the
prep. Thankfully we brought the flashy
gear, just in case.
Normally you’d expect the shoot to have
already been well underway by the time we
arrived but people were only just arriving
in their tinted Range Rovers and Rolls.
I didn’t say anything but I made damn sure
everyone got a head start on the veg and
sauces because as this rate it would be a
miracle if they’d be eating before nine.
Another hour passed with a couple more
cars trickling in, but still no one had set
out. Instead, I could see them through the
leaded windows, just watching us work.
Finally, after another half hour I had the
house staff fetch the butler. He eventually
came out, dour as before, and I told him
that unless he knew something I didn’t
there was going to be a distinct lack of
venison for tonight’s venison medallions.
He just gave me this look, told me to
“prepare” and then headed back inside.
Obviously that pissed me right off but what
can you do? They’d paid for the day so we
just hunkered down and looked busy.
[9]

Finally, as the sun was starting to set a
bloody red behind the woodland, the guns
came out with their entourage, all tweed,
Winchesters and dogs and in front of them
marched this… matriarch.
I don’t know how else to describe her. This
big, imposing, like some Roman statue
brought to life and given a gun. I kept
thinking of my army days cooking for the
top brass. She had the same eyes, like they
didn’t see people any more just “assets”
and “resistance.” And if that wasn’t
enough, she had this huge custom rifle
over her shoulder, like an antique elephant
gun or something. There was no way it was
UK legal, the thing looked like it could take
out a jeep, never mind a stag! And it wasn’t
gilded or anything, it was dull and plain
looking despite its massive size and you
just knew that this was a gun for killing
with, not showing off.
It was her domain and she reeked of power
and authority in every sense of the word
and when she spoke they all listened.
She had the guns all line up facing us with
their dogs at heel and then they all just
stood there watching the sun set as their
staff and security all headed back into the
house leaving us alone with them. That
was when I knew something was really
wrong.
The woman stepped forward with her dogs
by her side and faced me with this bright
and wide smile splitting her face under her
electric blue eyes and gunmetal-grey hair.
Then she just locked eyes with me and
began to carefully load the rifle without
looking, punctuating each word with
another cartridge.
“Are you prepared?” she asked quietly.
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

“As we can be” I replied. “but-“
Then she raised her hand to silence me
and it was as though she had slapped a
gag in my mouth. I couldn’t even think of
disobeying her, the words just died in my
throat.
She returned to the group her dogs
flanking her the whole way and her
silhouette outlined in the blood-red dusk
light. I couldn't make out any of the other’s
faces, dazzled as I was by the light.
Then she stood tall and proud and said
with just the tiniest hint of anticipation:
“Let’s begin then shall we?”
As one, the hunters raised their rifles as
one and levelled them at us as we stood
transfixed under our gazebo.
Theres a very specific feeling you get when
you’re staring down a barrel at close range.
First the world gets very sharp and bright,
then the horizon sort of shrinks around
you till it’s no wider than the dark hole
aiming straight at you. It had been a long
time since I’d felt like that, but it was still
so familiar. Too familiar.
The woman hadn’t raised her own weapon,
instead she called as though directing a
firing squad:
“Hunt.”
None of us replied. None of us even
breathed. We stood completely still and
silent, the only noise the gentle evening
breeze through the trees and the slight
hiss of the red wine reduction boiling over
beside me. There wasn’t even any
birdsong. Then I realized, she wasn't
talking to the other guns, she was talking
to us.

[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023
After seconds that felt like hours the
woman seemed to grow impatient. Finally,
she sighed and repeated:
“Hunt” before shouldering her rifle,
sighting and then pulling the trigger
without hesitation.
There was a deafening gunshot that
stabbed at my eardrums, leaving them
ringing and then a sudden clatter of
someone falling to the ground behind me
dragging utensils down with them. I
couldn’t turn to see who was hit, but I think
it was Steven. He was only twenty-three. I
know it was a headshot though, you don’t
forget that sound.
Without lowering the rifle, she chambered
another round and re-sighted, this time at
me. She smiled greedily then pumped her
eyebrows just once, playfully.
“Hunt!”
And this time, I understood. Without taking
my eyes from her I reached out and gently
closed my hand around the handle of the
clever in front of me. It shone, pristine and
unblemished, ready for its bloody work.
Then slowly, so slowly, I raised it
overhead, bracing myself for what
followed.
The woman grinned widely, her finger
caressing the trigger, then I brought my
hand down sharply, smashing the cleaver
into the face of Marcus, our Saucier. He
couldn’t even cry out as it cleft deep into
the base of his neck, his arterial blood
gushing out and down into the overly-hot
pot, releasing a plume of acrid ironsmelling steam.
I looked down at his carcass then wiped
the blood from my brow and yanked the

[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023
blade free with a crunch before turning to
the rest of my staff. They ran.
The party ate well that night. All told, it
didn't take long, maybe a half hour at
most? None of them got far. I caught Debra
as she tried to hide up in a tree. Fair play to
her, almost made it up there despite being
in her fifties. Mira tripped over a rabbit hole
in the darkness, I think she tried to beg, but
I couldn’t make out the words.
The only one who gave me any real trouble
was Boris. He was a big guy, nearly six
five, and that’s a hell of a size difference,
even with my training. But it wasn’t
enough. I had killed before, and he hadn’t.
He hesitated, and that was that.
As I was packing up, the woman shook my
hand and complimented me. Then the
butler handed me a thick brown envelope.
It was full of cash and a note written in
elegant cursive with just one word:
“Run”.
And I did. Can't stay anywhere too long,
can't stop moving. I keep hearing dogs
barking and I don't know if it's just some
pet or…
I thought about handing myself in to the
police, but that just feels like trapping
myself in a dead end.
So I’m getting out of the country. First the
channel tunnel and then keep going until
I’ve gone far enough that she can’tWait…
Beat
CATERER CONT.
(hushed)
Oh no…

[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023
The car window shatters inwards from a sudden loud gunshot. The
CATERER is wetly silenced.
Someone approaches, reloading an enormous rifle with growling dogs in
tow.
They stop then yank open the care door.
LADY MOWBRAY
Well run dearie. Well run...
The line goes dead.
3. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE – NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
CELIA takes a steady breath.
CELIA
(disturbed)
Well, that was…
LADY MOWBRAY
(too close)
Fascinating.
CELIA jumps up with a cry and turns to find Lady Mowbray and her dogs
standing right behind her. The dogs growl threateningly.
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
Sit.
CELIA
Excuse me?
LADY MOWBRAY
I was talking to the boys.
The dogs sit. They are not fur babies, they are what turns up when
someone says “release the hounds”.
CELIA
Can I uh- can I help you?
LADY MOWBRAY
I rather think you might…
MOWBRAY sniffs her as though she were a particularly odd vintage.
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
(stalking)
What did you say your name was dear?
CELIA
I didn’t.
LADY Mowbray chuckles slightly as her dogs begin to growl.
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
My, we are an odd one, aren’t we?
She sniffs again.
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
And braver than we look.
CELIA
You’re not allowed to be in here.
LADY MOWBRAY
I was invited.
The dogs growling intensifies.
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
A fine specimen… strong and… different…
What is that…?
She sniffs yet again. GWEN enters.
GWEN
(cautiously)
Lady Mowbray?
Beat. The tension holds for a moment then breaks; the dogs suddenly
sound smaller, more docile.
LADY MOWBRAY
That’s me yes. I presume you’re
Gwendolyn Bouchard?
GWEN
Er yes. Thank you for coming in. If you’d
like to follow me?
LADY MOWBRAY hesitates just for a moment.

[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023
GWEN CONT.
Lady Mowbray?
LADY MOWBRAY
Of course.
(To Celia)
Catch you next time, dearie.
CELIA
No, you won't.
LADY MOWBRAY chuckles then falls in behind Gwen with her dogs.
GWEN
(departing)
Can I get you any refreshments Lady
Mowbray?
LADY MOWBRAY
(departing)
No thank you dear. I recently ate.
GWEN
(suspecting)
Ah, um. Of course.
CELIA watches them depart.
LADY MOWBRAY CONT.
(distant)
Bouchard… You wouldn’t be of the
Cheshire Bouchard’s would you?
GWEN
(distant)
Oh, uh well actuallyA door closes cutting off their conversation.
Beat.
CELIA exhales shakily before turning back to the computer.

4. INT. CLUB - EVENING, CLEAR (ALICE’S PHONE).
The club is busy but not packed. A final guitar chord rings out as the
applause ends. After a few moment of, canned dance music comes in over
the speakers as people filter away from the stage.
Alice finishes off her drink as Luke approaches.
LUKE
There she is!
ALICE
(sardonic)
Oh my god it’s the guy from the band,
gosh, I'm giddy.
LUKE
Not surprised, the way you were flailing
about.
ALICE
How dare you. I am pushing the
boundaries of what it means to dance!
LUKE
I won’t argue with that.
(to barman)
Pint of water please mate. With ice.
(To Alice)
Thanks for coming Alice, you didn’t have
toALICE
(gesturing)
Clearly! I thought this was meant to be a
little chill side gig thing?
LUKE
So did I! Turns out though that things are
really picking up.
ALICE
(sardonic)
Hello? Yes? Is that Glastonbury? Why yes,
we DO have a minute…

[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023
LUKE
You joke but the managers already added
seven more cities to the Dredgerman tour.
ALICE
Oh wow, fair play!
The barman hands Luke his drink.
LUKE
Cheers mate!
LUKE almost downs the lot.
LUKE CONT.
How’s Sam by the way? It’s been years
since I saw the weedy git.
ALICE
Same as ever.
LUKE
Shame he couldn’t make it tonight.
ALICE
Yeah. Still, sometimes it's nice hang out
and have a drink, just to two of us.
LUKE
I’m flattered.
ALICE
You should be. And since the show’s
over…
LUKE
(to the barman)
Two pints of Doombar, cheers.
ALICE
(smiling and genuinely happy)
There we go.

5. EXT. CLUB ALLEY - EVENING, CLEAR (TAPE RECORDER).
A tape recorder CLICKS, distantly a body shuffles in an alley off the main
road.
VICTIM
- the second time is up I try to grasp the air
and fill my lungs that burn and rattle full.
I can’t, there’s so much air but none inside
as I go down again the cold surrounds and
drags me down, the blue the black the
weight of all the sodden fates awaiting me
below the line of sea and sky.
The VICTIM gasps for air.
I kick, I lunge I flail towards the brightened
blue and break above the third and final
time.
ALICE turns into the alleyway, heading home and still buzzing from the
show. She removes her headphones as she sees a figure muttering.

ALICE CONT.

VICTIM CONT.
I know I'm spent there is no
more within me save the saltspun death that reaches down
my throat

Hello?

The VICTIM shuffles towards Alice, stumbling, seemingly oblivious to her
but nonetheless still threatening.
VICTIM CONT.

ALICE
(cautious)

and spasms in my chest that
cannot breathe inside me

Uh Hi? Hello?

The VICTIM shuffles towards Alice, stumbling, seemingly oblivious to her
but nonetheless still threatening.

[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

VICTIM CONT.
coughs and sputters and tries to
push it out but more comes in

ALICE CONT.
Listen I er- I don’t have any
spare…

The VICTIM stumbles then falls to the ground, hard. They begin to writhe,
clutching at their throat.
VICTIM CONT.

ALICE CONT.

and down I go the third and final
time I know it's done

Jesus! Are uh… are you alright?

ALICE cautiously approaches, suddenly THE VICTIM grabs her in panic.

ALICE CONT.

VICTIM CONT.
i'm done
the water is...
is... dark

Oh shit! Get off! Get off me! Let
go!

ALICE manages to throw the Victim off then stands back watching them
writhe.
ALICE CONT.
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit!

The VICTIM begins to choke. ALICE approaches again cautiously
ALICE CONT.
Can you hear me? I’m- I’m
calling for help okay just- just
hold on yeah?
ALICE dials 999 whilst the victim continues to choke and gasp for air.

[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE CONT.
(on Phone)
Ambulance.
Just round the back of the
Gladstone Arms near uh… Lant
Street.
Yeah there’s someone I don’t know
if they’ve OD’d but they’re going
into a fit or something.
Uh Alice, yeah and wait… hang
on… oh shit, shit she’s stopped
breathing, yeah, yeah just hurry!
The VICTIM dies, impossible amounts of water chocking up out of her
lungs.
ALICE CONT.
Oh shit… oh shit…
Alice hesitantly begins chest compressions, singing to keep time
ALICE CONT.
(Rhythmic, under breath)
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk,
and said goodbye to the cir-cus,
Off she went with a trumpety trump,
Trump trump trump.
Nellie the elephant packed her trunk,
and said goodbye to theShit, shit, shit, shit!
She is panicking. She sees the tape recorder next to the body and picks it
up.
ALICE CONT.
What is-?

[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

The victim starts to speak again, quietly, bubbling up through the water
and out of dead lips.

ALICE CONT.

VICTIM CONT.
(whispered)
Deeper…
Deeper…
Down among the dead and
swollen flesh so pale within this
lightless place where eyes are
open cloudy white and all the
water pushes down upon a
lifeless form that sinks and
sinks down to the bottom that is
not there no sandy grave below
the swell no rest among the
coral and the depths I feared so
much but reached up and over
land to claim me still

Oh shit… You… But…
I-I'm sorry. I can't- I…

ALICE drops the tape recorder and flees. The dead woman's voice trails off.
