NDILISWA

NDILISWA!
ZHU-ANRAN (Singing)
...little carp, flying through the river there...watch how she swims...
NDILISWA
A-pa!
GAMMON
Alestes, you little tick, get up that rigging now!
ANH
Scared of heights, land-slug?
ALESTES
I was born in the water, dullard. I'm not a slug, I'm a carp!

ANH
What?
ALESTES
You heard me! I said, I'm a ALESTES (Reality)
'm a carp - can swim good as - YOU'RE a slug - oh. I don't feel BAKER
Get her in the bed!
NOOR
Gently, gently! We will not wake her by hitting her head.
INEZ
More's the pity.
NOOR
Not helpful, Inez.
SIVA
What can I do? What's wrong with her? Is it the sickly tummy from the bad fish
again?
BAKER
Inez, get blankets - she's got a feverNOOR
She will be well, Baker, we will see to it.

SEAS 5

SIVA
Shall I mop her brow? Make a broth? Bring cold water? I could read to her
from Homer! I find the original Greek most soothing - ‡ndra moi Žnnepe,
moœsa, polytropon, —s m‡la poll‡- [Tell me muse of the man of many ways,
who was driven-]
BAKER
Yes, yes, do - all of that, Siva.
[SIVA runs off]
BAKER (CONT'D)
Except the Homer!
NOOR
It is a fever. Quite simple to nurse, and Alestes is strong.
BAKER
Is she? I tell her not to over-exert herself - she gets these tired spells and then NOOR
Hmm.
BAKER
What?
NOOR
I do not like how her heart is beating. Feel.
ALESTES
Get OFF me you snake-bellied... I can take all of you any day...

NOOR
I suppose we should be grateful that she is still Alestes, even dreaming...

2. EXT. THE DECK OF THE GALLOPING ENGLISHMAN. DAY.
[ALESTES' memory]
GAMMON
My girls return!
(CREW cheer)
And they've only gone and got the BLOODY SWAG!
ALESTES
Well, Gammon, credit where credit's due - you couldn't have done it without
me.
[ANH coughs]
ALESTES
Us. Yep, me and Annie here ANH
Anh.
ALESTES
- have come up with the goods ANH
- once again.

GAMMON
Alright, enough showboating. What do you want, a medal?
ANH
Just our fair share of the prize, —c lon [pig brain].
GAMMON
Of course. A third for Alestes... and a quarter for Anh.
ANH
What?
GAMMON
Maybe that'll teach you keep a civil tongue in your head.
ANH
But Alestes - !
ALESTES
Alestes what?
ANH
The way you talk to him is a thousand times worse than the way I do ALESTES
I've earned the right to talk to him like that.
ANH
Earned the right to be a cheekyGAMMON

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Hold your tongue or get your pay docked, Anh.
ALESTES
You want to know how I earned the right?
ANH
How?
ALESTES
By being better than you!
[CREW noises of excitement]
ANH
I'll fight you any day, any way, with whatever weapon you can get your sea-rat
paws on.
ALESTES
Why wait? Right now is good for me!
[ALESTES draws her sword]
ANH
I thought you'd never ask!
[ANH draws her sword]
ALESTES
I hope you've got a will because GAMMON

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

ENOUGH! Shut up, all of you. Pissing about with brawls when there's money to
be made - put your swords away, girls Anh! Now! Alestes. Come on.
[Swords sheathed]
GAMMON
That's better. Alright, get the wax out of your fetid ears and listen up - duty
roster.
BAKER
Alestes? Alestes!
ALESTES
What? Not now, I have to listen to...
BAKER
Alestes!

3. INT. THE SICK BAY OF THE NETAOANSOM. LATER.
ALESTES
Anh... Gammon...
BAKER
It's alright. They can't hurt you now.
SIVA
Those names...
BAKER

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

It's nothing.
SIVA
Anh is... the pirate who kidnapped me.
NOOR
The one with the bamboo flute.
BAKER
Does it matter? That's the past.
NOOR
I do not think Siva being abducted and held at knife-point two weeks ago can
be said to be 'the past'!
SIVA
Yes, it was very traumatic for me, I still have trouble sleeping NOOR
It is clear that your past is rapidly becoming our present.
BAKER
Noor, we need more broth.
NOOR
Send for Inez, then.
BAKER
Noor!
NOOR

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

I am sorry, Baker - but if people are coming after us and you know who they
are SIVA
We do have a right to know.
BAKER
Yes. You do. But Alestes...
NOOR
You said, before, that your story was not only your story to tell. You were right.
This is now our story too.
BAKER
...They were called the Florists. The crew that Alestes and I sailed with before
the Netaoansom.
SIVA
The Florists! Ohh, I thought Anh was asking me about horticulturalists! No
wonder she was cross.
BAKER
I was just a ship's cook, a skivvy - but Alestes... she was his star pupil.
NOOR
His?
BAKER
Gammon. Commander of the Florists and Captain of The Galloping Englishman.
SIVA

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

(sniggers) Gammon.
BAKER
It was a nickname, and not a kind one. But it's good for those that have power
to laugh at themselves now and then. Makes it easier to believe they're your
friend.
NOOR
What happened?
BAKER
We sailed, and we fought, we plundered, we set sail again.
I saw Alestes becoming... something else. Something she hadn't always been. I
wanted us to leave. She'd put away a tidy sum, enough for us to return - to go
anywhere we wanted. She wouldn't hear of it. I think she was... enjoying
herself too much.
SIVA
But - you're here now, so...
NOOR
...what broke this Galloping Englishman's spell?

4. EXT. AN ISLET. MOONLIT NIGHT.
ALESTES
My GOD, old man, where are you taking me?
GAMMON

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Now, now, Alestes, good things come to those who wait.
ALESTES
Come quicker to those who nick them.
GAMMON
[laughing] Ah, you're a chip off the old... nevermind.
ALESTES
No, go on.
GAMMON
What?
ALESTES
You can say it.
GAMMON
What?
ALESTES
You think I'm good.
GAMMON
Ha!
ALESTES
You think I'm a natural!
GAMMON
My foot.

ALESTES
The most fearsome buccaneer on the seven seas since Anne and Mary
strapped on breaches!
GAMMON
Is that so?
[He sticks a foot out and trips ALESTES]
ALESTES
You tripped me!
GAMMON
You want to be the most fearsome buccaneer on the seven seas, you got to be
quicker on your pins than that.
ALESTES
Limey bastard.
GAMMON
Oi. English bastard. Right, we're here.
ALESTES
"Here" looks suspiciously like "everywhere else" on this godforsaken spit of
land.
GAMMON
"Here" is where we start looking.
ALESTES

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

For what? Treasure?
GAMMON
You really are a grubby little thief, aren't you? Yes, treasure.
ALESTES
Go on then, where's the map?
GAMMON
No map. Not for this one.
ALESTES
Then what?
GAMMON
Hush your yap, girl, and I'll tell you. There's a story to this hoard.
ALESTES
Course there is.
GAMMON
There are many ways to lay markers back to treasure, they say. Maps, notches
in trees, instructions whispered in a sleeping mermaid's ear ALESTES
Please don't go near any sleeping women, Gammon.
GAMMON
Do you want to hear this or not?
ALESTES

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

...fine.
GAMMON
But there's only one way to ensure that only the bravest and truest find what
you've laid in the dirt. Now I've taught you to dig, yes? How to pick a spot to
hide... sensitive items from the law? How to slip a boat onto a cay by
moonlight and be off again without so much as a whisper to tell you were ever
there?
ALESTES
...yes.
GAMMON
Exactly. You were trained, girl, just like generations of honest privateers before
you. And if there's one thing privateers like, it's a pet. Jammy, with his monkey.
Pike's got that old cat ALESTES
Kai with that bird that shits everywhere.
GAMMON
Kai with that bird that - exactly. But before monkeys and cats and incontinent
birds, there was one animal that was favoured of buccaneers everywhere: the
sea turtle.
ALESTES
The sea turtle?
GAMMON

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

It's true, true as I'm standing afore you now. And the more these pirates
looked after these turtles, the more a special bond grew up. Every Captain who
buried his treasure released two sea turtles at the same time, each fed with a
tiny, tiny nugget of the gold he was hiding. And if you can find those two
turtles that belong to a particular treasure, and you ask 'em with the right
words and the right manner - why they'll lead you right back to it, easy as
gooseberry pie.
ALESTES
BOLLOCKS.
GAMMON
True!
ALESTES
Oh, you almost had me there for a minute, you whey-faced, cloth-eared TREASURE-SEEKING TURTLES? Of all the things I've ever heard, that has to be
the stupidest damn - Are those - no.
GAMMON
Don't be so sure of yourself, Miss Alestes. There are more things in heaven and
earth.

5. INT. THE SICK BAY OF THE NETAOANSOM. LATER.
ALESTES
...turtles...s'not...stories, Gammon...
NOOR

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

Her heart beat's rising again. So is her temperature.
BAKER
No, no, no - Siva, we need more water - more cloths - get Inez to help [INEZ enters]
NOOR
Good, Inez - take Siva, get as many rags as you can find INEZ
We're being followed.
BAKER
What?
INEZ
Off the starboard bough, just a row boat. But it's been tailing us for the last
hour.
BAKER
Ay! Not now!
INEZ
What we do, Big Man?
BAKER
...we make Alestes well. She's our captain. Inez - get up there and keep an eye
on the boat - it gets any closer, you let us know. Siva SIVA

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Rags and water, I know.
ALESTES
I can't keep... I have to stop....

6. EXT. AN ISLET. MOONLIT NIGHT.
GAMMON
Come on girl, put some welly into it.
ALESTES
I'm digging faster than you, old man.
GAMMON
You're half my age, you should be hitting seabed by now.
ALESTES
Fine!
GAMMON
Here.
ALESTES
Bleurgh.
GAMMON
That's best English ale there, lass.
ALESTES
No kidding.

GAMMON
What do you want, Alestes?
ALESTES
Some beer that doesn't taste like piss would be nice.
GAMMON
No, no, no. From all this?
ALESTES
The beach?
GAMMON
Life, girl! I'm asking you what you want out of life.
ALESTES
Why?
GAMMON
I'm curious. Most of my crew, they're a simple lot, and I don't mind that. Full
bellies, weekly rum rations and a pretty girl or two when we make port. Or in
Anh's case, weekly rum rations, someone to kill, and a pretty girl or two when
we make port. But you... you don't give much away, do you?
ALESTES
Don't I?
GAMMON
Very good. You are a card.

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

ALESTES
What about you then, what do you "want"?
GAMMON
Me? Oh, I'm a simple chap, really. An easy life.
ALESTES
A bit more than weekly rum though?
GAMMON
True, true. I've got some plans. A few more hauls like the one you brought in
today and who knows?
(beat)
There. I've shared. Now you.
ALESTES
I want... the same, I suppose. A quiet life, a nice island to retire to, and a pile of
gold to keep me warm at night.
GAMMON
That's all?
ALESTES
That's all.
GAMMON
Who am I to judge? In that case, I think we can come to an accord.
ALESTES

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

What d'you mean?
GAMMON
A nice island and a pile of gold? I could fix you up tomorrow.
ALESTES
But my contract GAMMON
Early release for good behaviour.
ALESTES
This is a trick. You're not seriously offering to let me out GAMMON
I don't make promises I don't intend to keep.
ALESTES
Yes you do.
GAMMON
Alright, yes I do. But I don't renege on deals that are in my interest.
ALESTES
Deals?
GAMMON
Like I said, a private island and a mountain of gold. Could be yours tomorrow.
ALESTES
...what would I have to do?

7. INT. THE SICK BAY OF THE NETAOANSOM. LATER.
NOOR
Get another cloth, Inez!
INEZ
I'm doing it!
SIVA
What happened?
NOOR
I don't know, her temperature just shot up out of nowhere - feel her heart SIVA
Oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear BAKER
Siva, stop panicking, just keep that bucket topped up, we have to keep her
cool!
SIVA
Oh, oh, oh NOOR
Baker, she's peaking ALESTES
No no no no, won't...can't...you can't make me...

Trice Forgotten

SIVA
She's distressed!
INEZ
We're all distressed, Siva!
BAKER
Oi! Enough of that, go outside if you want to fight!
SIVA
Do we have any bananas on board?
INEZ
What?
SIVA
A banana skin laid across the forehead can help bring down a temperature! My
Nani used to BAKER
Siva!
SIVA
Right! Yes! I'll go and see if we've got one [a BUMP from somewhere against the hull of the boat]
NOOR
What was that?
BAKER

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

Sounded like... someone boarding.
SIVA
I - I'll go and see...
INEZ
No. I'll go. Could do with banging some heads together.
BAKER
Be careful! Come on, Alestes... where are you...

8. EXT. THE DECK OF THE GALLOPING ENGLISHMAN. DAWN.
GAMMON
That's right, while you lazy sacks of ordure snored in your bunks, the lady
Alestes and I were bringing home THIS.
[He kicks over a chest and gold coins pour onto the deck]
GAMMON
Feast your eyes, boys - there will be buns for tea. Oi! "Fingers" - you keep
yours to yourself or I'll get my sword out and everyone will wonder if that
nickname of yours is ironic. Bo'sun! Get this lot down to the treasury and a
heavy lock on the door - after Miss Alestes has taken her fair share, of course.
Don't you have jobs, you horrible reprobates? Get going!
ANH
Another successful mission, was it?
ALESTES

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

Mm.
ANH
You know, we could all be rich if he deigned to take the rest of us out on as
many...solo trips as he does you. I wonder why that is?
ALESTES
Piss off Anh, I need to sleep.
ANH
What's wrong with you? You usually can't wait to crow about Daddy's latest
favour.
ALESTES
Nothing - just leave it, yeah, Anh? I need to see - Baker!
ANH
Coward!
ALESTES
Baker. We have to leave.
BAKER
What?
ALESTES
Tonight. When we moor off Sibolga. We have to grab what we can and go, I've
got my gold stashed in an apple barrel so just be ready BAKER

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

Did something happen?
ALESTES
We can use the gold to buy a ship, make a bit of coin on the trade routes BAKER
Did you do something?
ALESTES
No - ! It wasn't me, it was Gammon offered me a deal. He said he'd buy out my contract if...
BAKER
If? Alestes...
ALESTES
He wants me to kill someone.
BAKER
Who? ...Me?
ALESTES
No. But. I can't. Maybe if I could, it would be better BAKER
No, child. You cannot buy freedom with something you'd regret for the rest of
your life.
ALESTES
I'm sorry, Baker.

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

BAKER
What for?
ALESTES
As soon as we run, they'll come after us. It won't be easy, just you and me
crewing a ship.
BAKER
Hey... You sound more like yourself than you have for a long time. That's
enough for me. Captain.
ALESTES
Captain. I do like the sound of that.
(beat)
...can you hear that?
BAKER
Hear what?
ALESTES
You - you must be able to hear...
[BAKER'S voice is far away]
BAKER
Alestes? Alestes, where are you?
ALESTES
Baker! I can't see you! Baker, where are - the bananas - they're - everywhere -

ALESTES

BAKER
It's alright, I'm here, I'm here.
INEZ
Aw. Sweet.
ALESTES
Where - this isn't my room... Why is there banana on my face?
NOOR
You are in the sick bay, Captain. You had a fever.
SIVA
Do you feel better now? Noor nursed you all through it, they were amazing, it
was truly to a privilege to watch NOOR
Myself and Baker have been keeping watch over you.
ALESTES
Oh... good... why are you all staring? Don't you have jobs to do?
INEZ
I think we can safely say she's feeling better.

ALESTES
You can get out now. I'll just... have a wash and a little nap and...
BAKER
That won't be possible.
ALESTES
Why? The ocean didn't evaporate while I was out, did it? Bring me some water
and BAKER
You have a visitor.
ALESTES
In the middle of the sea?
(beat)
Am I still asleep?
BAKER
No. They rowed here. Boarded an hour ago. You're... going to want to get
dressed.
ALESTES
Fine. Bring me my boots. And my biggest hat.

10. INT. ALESTES'S CABIN. NIGHT.
ALESTES

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

Get out of my chair.
GAMMON
Manners, Miss Alestes. "A merry host makes merry guests." Did I teach you
nothing?
ALESTES
Guests are usually invited, Gammon. Get out.
GAMMON
I just want to have a little chat. A social call, really. You look like shit, by the by.
ALESTES
At least that's unusual for me.
GAMMON
Can't say I care for the service here but it's always hard to find a decent cup of
char outside of Blighty, isn't it?
ALESTES
Whatever you have to say, I don't care.
GAMMON
Oh, I think you might.
ALESTES
Why, have you suddenly become interesting in the last two years?
GAMMON
So young, and so untender!

Trice Forgotten

Lay Day

ALESTES
[half drawing sword]
I swear to GAMMON
I've buried my treasure.
ALESTES
You've - what?
GAMMON
Business has been good since you left. In a way, you solved my problem,
leaving like you did. Anh's really stepped up since I gave her her own ship.
ALESTES
So? I've got my own ship too - whatever, Gammon.
GAMMON
The money's been pouring in, a bit too noticeably for my comfort - so I'm
leaving some of it in an... on-shore account.
ALESTES
And why should I believe you?
GAMMON
You don't have to.
ALESTES
It's a trick.

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

GAMMON
Could be.
ALESTES
But why would you tell me? Why invite me to go looking for your stash?
GAMMON
Because I like you, Alestes. I always did. It's a shame we couldn't be friends
but... we don't have to be enemies. My little birdies tell me you're trying to get
into the merchant business. Pottery, and the like? A clean break from all this
nasty piracy. The treasure I've buried, it's more than enough for you to afford
what only money can buy: a quiet life. No more sailing, no more violence.
ALESTES
As if I need handouts from the likes of you.
GAMMON
Trade must be very good around these parts.
ALESTES
Booming. ...Right. Well. Information received. You can go now.
GAMMON
One last thing.
ALESTES
Isn't there always?
GAMMON

Trice Forgotten

SEAS 5

Lay Day

My treasure. There's no map. No notches on trees. No words whispered in a
mermaid's ear.
ALESTES
Don't tell me...
GAMMON
You'll need these.
ALESTES
Bloody sea turtles. ...Give them, then.
GAMMON
Ah ah ah - not so fast. You know me, Alestes, I love a deal.
ALESTES
Yeah yeah, the "favour" you had Anh extort from me by kidnapping my crewmate. I've already said yes.
GAMMON
Exactly! You've already said yes! You've got to sweeten the pot a little more
than that, my dear! Give me something new, something... original.
ALESTES
What... would you want for the turtles?
GAMMON
That's not the question, is it? The question is - what are you prepared to give?
