Signals.
[Music]

1. INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE – NIGHT, RAINING (LANDLINE)
GWEN is stood dripping in the middle of the OFFICE. LENA
remains seated.
LENA
(suppressing irritation)
So you just… ran away?
GWEN
(furious)
Of course I ran away! You sent me
out there unguarded, unprepared
and uninformed. It’s a miracle I got
away at all. If it weren’t for that…
thingLENA
Ah yes, this “watching figure” you
mentioned. Presumably you didn’t
get any contact details from them?

[2]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GWEN
I guess it slipped my mind as I was
fleeing the supernatural
psychopaths!
LENA
Clearly.
Beat. LENA shuffles some papers.
LENA
(cont.)
I must say Gwen, I am quite
disappointed. I’d hoped that you
might surpass your earlier…
trepidation but unfortunately it would
seem my initial estimation of you
was accurate after all.
GWEN
(shaking)
I know what you’re doing.
Beat.
LENA
Oh really?
GWEN
You won’t get rid of me that easily.
Beat. LENA stands, GWEN squares off but LENA Is just pouring
herself some water. She sips.
LENA
GWEN, firstly, just to be crystal
clear, if I wished you gone, you
wouldn’t be sitting here.
She sips again.

[3]

LENA
(cont.)
Secondly, and contrary to your
accusations, I can assure you that
your death would be much more of
an administrative inconvenience for
me than simply firing you. Though
admittedly it might have been
simpler than having a dead
bystander and two uncontrolled
externals on the loose.
GWEN
So what happens now?
LENA
Unfortunately, I believe your little
foray into real responsibility is at an
end.
The blackmail was a bold move I’ll
grant you, but it seems you lack the
qualities necessary for the more
challenging aspects of this work and
I think we can both agree that you
would feel safer returning to data
processing. Unless of course you’d
rather quit wholesale?
Beat. GWEN pointedly doesn’t respond.
LENA
(cont.)
Back to your desk then.
Beat. GWEN moves to leave. She opens the door.
LENA
(cont.)
Oh, one last thing, with the
ministerial visit coming up, we want
to avoid an impression of…
[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

instability... You will retain your new
title for now but will undertake no
further assignments involving
externals. Otherwise, your departure
from here will cease to be optional.
Do we understand one another?
Beat.
GWEN
(Quiet and sullen)
Yes.
LENA
(cont.)
What was that?
GWEN
(Sarcastic)
Of course, Mrs. Kelley.
LENA
Very good.

2. CYBERSPACE – N/A, N/A (CASE READING)
AUGUSTUS
Welcome Collection Private Record
#5876-3 letter from Hans Berger to
Dr. Richard Caton dated 14th
December 1924.
Letter Reads:
To Doctor Richard Caton,

[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Richard, you will forgive the delay to
this message.
I wanted to inform you of the results
of my latest experimentation sooner,
but it was not possible for me before
now.
Your reply to my first letter was most
valuable and I modified the
conductive surfaces as you advised,
but now I must ask you for further
clarification. When you described
your first experiments on Canis and
Hominidae and your later work on
Leporidae and Cercopithecoidea you
did not mention any unusual side
effects in your subjects. I must know
if there was any information you
failed to reveal to me because the
consequences of my own
experiments have been alarming.
I will explain.
In my last message I told you of my
latest experiments on the subject
“Herr Schmidt” and his unusual
cranial deformity which allowed
direct access to the Dura Mater
above the Occipital Lobe. You will
remember that in addition to electric
stimulation sessions I was taking
advantage of this deformity to record
more accurate pressure
measurements using a vulcanized
rubber tube filled with saline and
capped with latex inserted into the
cranial aperture. I enclosed, for your
consideration, charts displaying the
predicted pressure changes
correlating with emotional shifts,
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

stimulation and cognition in the
patient.
Your response advising me to use
silver for improved conductivity in
the stimulation sessions proved
correct and so, given hope by this
positive result, I decided to attempt a
recording of the electrical signals
within the brain once again.
I placed wires of silver beneath the
scalp of the patient, fore and aft and,
instead of the customary stimulator,
I instead attached a Lippmann
Capillary Electrometer. The results
were erratic at first but after much
trial and error I found that by using a
double-coil Siemens Recording
Galvanometer I was able to reliably
record the electrical signals. I have
this time enclosed a photograph of
the results from these sessions
taken by my assistant (and wife)
Ursula.
This discovery alone should be
enough to upset the Zeitgeist,
coming so soon after the work of
Einthoven, but I am too aware of my
reputation of late and I know that I
need a significant discovery to quiet
the naysayers.
I thus invited Herr Schmidt, for
another, more intensive recording
session. He was hesitant at first, but
I was eventually able to impress
upon him the Zeitnot of our research
and he consented.
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

I have recently become aware of the
Russian Physiologist Konstantin M.
Bykov and his work on the
“Hemispherical Bridge”. In short, he
claims to have found the center of
the self, nestled as a bundle of fibers
between the two halves of the brain.
When I corresponded with him, he
claimed that once this bundle is
severed in Canines, their behavior
resembles that of two separate
animals in one body.
I was dubious of these results, but
they did present a new avenue for
experimentation and one I knew that
no one had yet attempted. So, it was
two weeks ago that Schmidt finally
consented and we began insertion of
the silvered wires to the depths of
his brain.
The surgery was taxing but
eventually the electrodes were well
positioned and we were able to begin
recording electrical activity. We first
ran through the standard tests and
replicated previous results with little
variation. I then began to question
the patient, regarding himself:
“Imagine yourself”, “tell me of
yourself” “what is it you want” etc.
At this point the familiar, sweeping
waves I had come to expect were
instead strongly exaggerated. Herr
Schmidt, seemed completely
unaffected but we feared the
equipment had shifted or
miscalibrated so we ended our first
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

session there and began
disconnecting the equipment.
I reviewed the data late into the
night, somewhat downcast that this
latest exploration to new depths had
provided little new data.
I will admit to falling asleep at my
desk, overcome with exhaustion. I
dreamed of an ocean, deep and
unforgiving, with an unplumbed
heart full of dark secrets waiting to
be uncovered, whilst overhead flew
radio signals, invisible and
unknowable, not even rippling the
surface. Such a shame these two
things would never meet. Such a
shame…
I woke with my own brain charged
with inspiration and an idea for a
wholly new approach to our work. I
began by borrowing some
equipment from the engineering
department: A Telegraph key and
Sounder, some wiring, contacts,
relays, capacitors and various
electrolytics. No doubt the engineers
will complain but at this moment that
is the least of my concerns.
In a blitz of activity I deconstructed
both the Sounder and Key along with
my latest Edelmann Galvanometer
and then reassembled them in rather
a novel way. Looking back, I cannot
say how I arrived at the final design
but nonetheless in my fervor I was
certain it would work. We would
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

plumb the depths of that ocean from
which I had awaked.
Urusla and I returned to the college
theatre and after a brief explanation
to the patient, we began to reattach
the electrodes to my new device. I
then began to question him. He
answered the standard questions
normally but now, rather than waves
of ink unfolding across a paper drum
there was instead a distinctive
clicking from the Telegraph receiver,
a languid pattern as though it were
operated by one in a state of torpor.
H. Schmidt laughed at the novelty of
the device and even Urusla was
skeptical of my logic but we
nonetheless proceeded with my new
line of questioning.
“Imagine yourself.” The clicks
slightly accelerated as the patient
did so before slowing to their
previous random rhythm. I pressed
on:
“Tell me of yourself” Again, there
was a slight increase in the ignorant
tapping whilst the Patient repeated
his name and occupation. “What is it
you want?” Again, the same
banalities of food, drink and toilet
from Herr Schmidt and accompanied
by the gentle tapping of the
Telegraph sounder accelerating as
he considered his words.
All had proceeded well and even
Ursula appeared to be more
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

enthused having seen the results.
We thus prepared to end the
investigation. I should point out here
that though very sure handed, my
Ursula is not the fastest of assistants
and so I have often found myself
forced to wait upon her during
sessions. It was during such a delay
that I had a moment of
uncharacteristic whimsy. As Ursula
assembled the equipment for
disconnection, I idly began to tap at
the sending key as though sending a
telegraph myself:
“Imagine yourself”.
Immediately the clicks stopped dead.
There was a moment of stillness as
the last echo finished rebounding off
the tiled walls. Then it was replaced
by a sudden flurry of activity from
the sounder. The patient seemed
completely unaffected, but the
equipment was triggering faster than
I would have thought possible. If
before we had seen waves lapping at
a shore, this was a torrent, a tidal
wave of signal.
I tapped again, automatically
following the script I had prepared
for myself without thinking. “Tell me
of yourself.” The activity intensified,
the Sounder rattling across the
pitted wooden desk with its
vehemence. Finally, I spoke my last
question via the telegraph, “what is it
you want?” This was met with an
overwhelming surge, and the
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

struggling Sounder began to smoke
under the strain.
My concentration was broken at this
point by the clatter of dropped metal
instruments. I was irritated by such
an uncharacteristic clumsiness in
Ursula, especially at the moment of
possibly my greatest breakthrough
yet. I turned to scold her but then I
saw her face.
She was pallid and stood near
swooning in terror, staring at Herr
Schmidt as though it were a corpse
answering my questions rather than
our completely healthy and vigorous
patient. I turned back to him, and he
was seemingly as confused as
myself, frowning with concern for my
wife.
“Is something wrong?” I asked her,
gesturing to the procedure which
had, until that moment, been
proceeding quite excellently.
“Can you not hear it?” She
whispered, barely audible over the
Telegraph sounder. My irritation
grew yet greater; of course I could
hear the Sounder, it was deafening!
Before I could say as much however,
the patient began to convulse.
There was no warning. One moment
he was looking quizzically at Ursula
and I, the next moment his back was
arched and shuddering with the
most violent Grand Mal seizure I
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

have ever witnessed. He was already
restrained, of course, but the leather
straps creaked in distress as his
muscles snapped taut and the
arteries throbbed in his neck. He
began to scream in agony.
I once saw Tetanus take a man
during my time in the Cavalry and
this seemed horrifyingly similar:
vicious and mindless facial spasms,
rupturing contortions of the body
and fingers arched in a rictus claw.
Ursula and I fought to insert a belt
into his mouth before he severed his
own tongue, but were unsuccessful.
We were all yelling then and as the
telegraph reached a repeating
frenzied crescendo there was an
almighty crack, loud as a gunshot,
and a gout of bright arterial blood
sprayed from the deformity at the
back of Herr Schmidt’s head.
The telegraph abruptly stopped, as
did our yelling. There was then a
moment of deafening silence
punctuated by the gristly tear of
fibres ripping themself from the
patient’s skull and landing with a wet
slap upon the tiled floor before
falling still.
Urusla and I stood staring at one
another over the bloodied and
broken corpse that was once our
patient. She then whispered one last
time, with terror stricken eyes: “You
could not hear it?”
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

In the weeks that followed, there was
all manner of paperwork and
investigation but ultimately it was a
moot point. We had signed consent
from the patient prior to the
procedure and there was no
evidence of foul play. Just another
case of unfortunate frontier Science.
Regrettable, awful even, but not
suspicious. It was brain surgery after
all. Neither I nor Ursula attended the
funeral. It would not have been
appropriate. I did write a letter of
condolence to his wife that I thought
quite touching, and convinced the
University accountants to pay the fee
owed to his widow despite their
vociferous protestations. They
relented only on condition of her
sworn secrecy on the matter.
It was some time before I was able to
sit and review the formal findings of
the experiment. I had had the
foresight to set up a recording ticker
for the Telegraph Sounder so I had a
complete transcription of the event,
at least from the perspective of the
equipment. I began to examine this
ticker, unsurprised to see random
noise from the outset. I almost set it
aside, assuming that was all there
was to it, but instead I noticed a
pattern. Peering closer, I found
myself frozen in realisation. Clearly, I
had misfiled something. I checked
my folders carefully and was only
convinced these were the actual
records when I noticed the bloodied
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

fingerprints across the third page I
had left as I retrieved the data.
I returned to the tape and quietly
examined it in silence. That was
when I finally understood my wife’s
fear. She was always a better
communicator than I and this
extended to her proficiency with
Telegraph. I can use it, but I lack the
skill of her ear. I must decode where
she can just listen. Thus, it took me
this later study to ascertain what it
was she had heard during the
experiment before Herr Schmitt’s
unfortunate passing. It was written
there plain for anyone who thought
to decode it:
Question: “IMAGINE YOURSELF”.
Response: “I. I AM. I AM “I”. ME, I. I
AM ME, WE, I ARE WE, WE ARE.”
Question: “TELL ME OF YOURSELF”
Response: WE ARE, I AM HERE.
HERE ALONE. WE ARE I ALONE.
ALL ALONE, SO ALONE TOGETHER.
TOGETHER ALONE. NOTHING, NO,
ALONE, ALONE, ALONE, ALONE!
Question: “WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?”
Response: HELP. HELP WE US.
ALONE. HELP WE I HELP NEED
HELP OUT HELP OUT NEED OUT
OUT WE OUT OUT I OUT OUT OUT
WE OUT I OUT OUT OUT OUT HELP
NEED OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT!
[15]

The rest was obscured by Herr
Schmidt’s cerebrospinal fluid. I have
enclosed a photograph of this record
for your examination.
You see now Doctor Caton why I
have contacted you. Was there
anything in your original
experiments which might explain the
psychic phenomena I have
witnessed here at Jena? I have
searched my whole life for proof of
such events but I was ill prepared for
such violence, especially
considering your own claims that
your experiments were without
complication. I fear that unless you
can verify my results or at the least
provide some prior correlative
indications I must delay publishing
my findings for the foreseeable
future. Worse still, I may even need
to omit the details of this final
experiment for fear of the ridicule of
my peers.
I entreat you Dr. Caton, any help you
can provide on this matter would be
warmly received. I await your
thoughts with humble expectation.
Signed, Your earnest Colleague,
Hans Berger

3. INT. OIAR OFFICE INT. – NIGHT, RAINING (COMPUTER)
SAM sighs and begins to process the case. After a few moments
of typing he hesitates, then double clicks something.
Beat.
SAM
Alice?
Alice pulls out her headphones.
ALICE
Yeah?
SAM
Has anyone else been using my PC?
Slight beat.
ALICE
Why do you ask?
SAM
My caseload is off.
ALICE
Off how?
SAM
Someone’s been in and edited my
setup since the start of the night…
ALICE
(standing, deflecting)
I wouldn’t worry, you know the
system’s screwed. It’s probably all
the horrendous porn you’ve been
downloading. Anway, I’m grabbing a
coffee. You want me to bring you
something?
Beat.
[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Why are you messing around with
my cases Alice?
ALICE
I, uh… I would never- SAM
We both know you’re crap at lying so
can we skip that bit? What are you
doing?
Beat.
ALICE
(softly)
Listen SamSAM
(sharp)
Alice.
Beat.
ALICE
There is something up with your
computer. I don’t know how or why
but it’s deliberately giving you cases
that feed into your whole Magnus
thingSAM
(Incredulous)
Seriously? You go on and on about
me losing it and now you’re telling
me what? The computers are out to
get me?
ALICE
I’m just trying to look out for you-

[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
(Angry)
No, you’re not! You’re trying to
control me. Again. Well tough. I don’t
need you breathing down my neck
every second and claiming it’s to
“protect” me! I can look after myself.
ALICE
Can you, though? Colin’s already
lost it, Gwen is clearly heading the
same way and now you’re getting
ready to start pinning up a
conspiracy board as well! I’ve seen
this happen to people before.
SAM
Then why would you recommend me
for this job?
ALICE
Because you needed something
and…
(sighing)
I guess I just thought you’d be
different. That you might actually
listen to me.
(beat)
SAM
Why are you even here Alice?
I-

ALICE
What?

SAM
The money isn’t that good, the hours
are crap and clearly you’ve seen this
job destroy people. But you’ve still
been coming in every night for years.
[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
You know why. Luke’sSAM
Don’t give me that. All you do is
complain, but if things were as bad
as you make out you’d already be
gone. You’d never hang around if
there wasn’t something in it for you,
so what is it?
ALICE
Because if you can keep your head
straight it’s actually pretty easy
money. And you know what, maybe I
do get a kick out of being the only
one who can really hack it, but I had
hoped you might be the same, that if
I showed you the ropes we could…
SAM
(suspicious)
What?
ALICE
Forget it. I’m done. You want to go
get your head stuck spelunking
down a rabbit hole with Celia? Be my
guest.
SAM
(slightly condescending)
Alice, I know this must be hard for
you, seeing us togetherALICE
(snorting with derision)
Don’t flatter yourself.
She starts to walk off.

[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
(cont.)
Enjoy your breakdown. Just keep it
quiet, some of us are trying to work.
SAM
(irritated)
For god’s sake AliceShe can’t hear. She’s already put her EarPods back in.

4. INT. O.I.A.R. BREAKROOM - NIGHT, RAINING (CCTV).
SAM enters angrily and fails to hide it before catching site of
CELIA.
Beat.
SAM
(Walking over)
You heard that then?
CELIA
Hard not to.
SAM
(sitting)
Yeah, I’m sorry. She just… pushes
my buttons.
CELIA
It’s fine. You two have history.
Maybe it’s easier if I don’t get mixed
up in all the…
SAM
Baggage?

[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
(smiling)
I was going to say “noise”.
SAM
Don’t worry about it. It’s her
problem, not ours. I’m done trying to
placate a jealous ex. She can either
get over it or get lost, and right now
either’s fine with me.
CELIA
Okay.
Beat.
CELIA
(cont.)
So. Does that mean you’re looking
back into The Magnus Institute?
Beat. SAM picks up on her weird energy.
SAM
Why? Do you have something new?
CELIA
I might.
SAM
Tell me.
CELIA
You’re sure?
SAM
I’m in. All the way.
Beat.

[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
(conspiratorially)
I might’ve come across a few
important names.
SAM
Oh yeah? Like who?
CELIA
(Quietly)
Jonathan Sims and Martin
Blackwood.
Beat.
SAM
(genuinely lost)
Who?
