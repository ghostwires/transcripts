Thank you to The Magnus Archives
for showing me an asexual character
who fell in love and keeping me sane
during lockdown.

Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus
Protocol.
Episode Twenty-One – Breaking
Ground.
[Music]
1. INT. OIAR BREAKROOM – NIGHT, DRIZZLING (CCTV)
SAM sits staring quietly out the window.
Celia enters.
CELIA
Enjoying the rain?
SAM
More drizzle, really.
CELIA
Yeah. Coffee?
SAM
Got one thanks.
CELIA
How about a coffee you haven’t let
get stone cold?
SAM
(smiling)
I’m good thanks.
[2]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA sits.
SAM takes a sip and regrets it.
CELIA
Look I know what Alice said got to
you but it’s only because she cares.
SAM
I know.
CELIA
I do too, we all do. Well, maybe not
Lena…
SAM
You barely know me.
CELIA
Maybe. Then again maybe digging
into sinister secrets together boosts
you up the old affection track a bit.
SAM
(smiling)
Yeah, maybe.
CELIA
But that’s not it, is it?
SAM
Not entirely. It’s more… what if she’s
right?
CELIA
About stopping with the Institute
stuff?
SAM
About working for the OIAR. I know
Alice can square it with her whole
“everything’s-evil-in-late-stage-

[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023

capitalism” thing, but I don’t know if
I can.

CELIA
You thinking of quitting?
SAM
Maybe. Whatever weird, creepy stuff
is going on I’m really starting to
doubt we’re on the right side of it.
CELIA
I suppose there’s plenty of non-evil
jobs out there for a smart, charming
guy like you. Maybe not law but…
SAM
Hah. No I, uh… I couldn’t go back.
CELIA
If you get desperate there’s always
the old “beep-beep”.
SAM
Beep-beep?
CELIA
Checkout.
SAM
Ah, yeah. Well that’s the real
question isn’t it? Does my desire not
to actively promote evil outweigh my
fear of disappointing my parents?
CELIA
That’s a tough one. Maybe you could
stay and try to make things better
from the inside?
SAM
[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Of course. Because that’s such a
traditionally surefire way to achieve
change.

CELIA
Might still be better than living in
London on a retail wage.
SAM
True.
(sighing)
For now, I’m probably just going to
stay and keep digging. No sense
quitting until I have a better idea of
what’s going on and if I get fired for
it, well… that works too, I guess.
CELIA
And if it turns out its as dangerous
as Alice says?
SAM
Yeah, well, if like a psycho goatmonster or something tries kills me,
I’ll definitely quit.
CELIA
Good policy.
SAM sips his coffee again and remembers why he isn’t drinking
it.
SAM
And you?
CELIA
I couldn’t afford to leave even if I
wanted to.
SAM
[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Sure. But something else is
bothering you. Has been ever since
we met.
CELIA
Hmmmm.
SAM
You want to talk about it?
CELIA
Not really.
SAM
Fair enough.
CELIA
(hesitant)
Let’s just say I have a… complicated
immigration status.
SAM
Really? Surprised the Civil Service
didn’t pick that one up.
CELIA
I think the OIAR might be a bit less
rigorous than the other branches.
Anyway, if I had to go back, I
couldn’t take Jack with me but
staying with him means I have some
difficult decisions to make.
Beat.
SAM
Look, Celia, if there’s anything,
anything, I can do to help you and
Jack…
CELIA
You really mean that.
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
I do.

CELIA
Thanks Sam. I’ll keep that in mind.
Pause.
They embrace.
CELIA
Well, if neither of us is quitting we
should probably get back.
SAM
Yeah, institutional evil doesn’t just
grow on trees right?
They chuckle halfheartedly as the joke dies painfully.

2. CYBERSPACE – N/A, N/A (CASE READING)
CHESTER
From the desk of Mr. Leonardo
Kennings ACCA, co-treasurer of the
Magnus Institute, Manchester to his
esteemed brethren of the same.
My most distinguished colleagues,
By now, I’m sure you have all read
the proposal in detail and made your
own personal assessments of the
formulae and calculations submitted
by Dr Welling and his team. I
wouldn’t for a moment criticise the
fine work they’ve done, or the
compelling case they’ve made for
the potential transmutative
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

properties of the dome, nor do I
believe they are mistaken about the
potential power we might be able to
harness were we to sponsor an
exhibit of our own there. I cannot
however, in good conscience
support the project as it has been
laid out, nor do believe it is a useful
expenditure of the Institute’s
significant, but certainly not infinite,
financial and political resources.
I have spoken before about my
concerns over the choice of the
millennium as the date for our grand
experiment. I do accept, to a certain
degree, Dr Welling’s proposition that
the turning of the millennium is an
important psychological focus of
transmutation, thanks to the cultural
emphasis of change placed upon the
shifting of an “age”. That said, I still
believe that determining the date
should be the province of the
astrological, not the cultural. The
constellations have played a key role
in our researches for centuries, and I
fully reject the notion that they
should be dismissed as irrelevant to
the Great Work in such a way as the
Christian god has been summarily
discarded.
It should be kept in mind that the
year 2000 has no relevance for
cultures that do not use the
Gregorian calendar, of which there
are many. It means nothing to the
Chinese, Indian or Hebrew
calendars, and thus excludes vast
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

swathes of the global population
from our equations. The stars, by
contrast, are eternal and near
unchanging thereby providing a far
more stable base for a project that
has always been conceived of as a
universal transmutation.
I understand, of course, that this
particular debate is one that myself
and those who think as I do have
long since lost and I do not wish to
re-awaken old schisms when a unity
of purpose is so profoundly vital to
the success of our endeavors at this
time. Nonetheless, I believe it is
worth raising once again in relation
specifically to the Millenium
Exhibition proposal, as to go forward
with this would tie our intentions
even more irrevocably to this
conception of Gregorian dates as
having true and meaningful
significance.
Even beyond this, admittedly more
abstract consideration, I believe that
the Dome project is almost uniquely
dangerous to our work as a place of
power.
The calculations provided by Dr
Welling and his team presuppose
that any outputs from the site will be
broadly balanced; that as a symbol
of the future it captures both
optimism and despair – the belief in
a better world and the terror that a
new millennium will bring nothing
except new ways to suffer. It is my
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

belief, however, that the actual
balance of energies involved will be
profoundly skewed towards the
fearful and despairing thus
invalidating the majority of the
calculations provided by Dr Welling
and his team.
Public support for the Dome is
limited, at best, and the stated plans
hardly inspire confidence in its
utopian ideals. Even beyond this
however, Dr Welling’s calculations
have failed to account for aspects of
stagnation.
This modern social and political
order, following the fall of the USSR,
has taken root in the popular
imagination as a natural and final
state of society with an emergent
and inherent stability. The turning of
the millennium is therefore felt as an
“end of history” to borrow a term,
and in this context the Dome may be
seen as a monument to this order. A
full stop. Not to mention a desperate
cry for relevance from an imperial
power locked in a death-spiral of
diminishing importance.
If my suspicions on these points are
correct, these echoes of stagnation,
almost entirely antithetical to our
transformative ambitions, make the
exhibition profoundly unsuitable to
be utilized in the work.
And this is not to mention the
location problem as I believe it may
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

already be in the process of
developing into a locus without our
intervention.
You are familiar with the peninsular
on the which the edifice is to be
constructed – Dr Welling et al
explained it in the proposal, though
not in great detail. Specifically, I
would note that they rather glossed
over its history as a gas works, and
the incredible levels of soil toxicity
that still remain in the area, currently
the focus of much of the building
and land reclamation efforts that will
ultimately allow for the Dome’s
construction.
Knowing this proposal was
forthcoming, and suspecting that it
would elide this particular concern, I
myself made the journey down to
London some weeks ago to
personally inspect the site. I still
have connections and clout enough
to have a tour arranged on my behalf
and what I saw there troubled me
deeply.
The laborers were in poor shape –
grey faced with blank expressions as
they shifted barrows of dirt and
shovelled sodden earth with such
rhythmic defeat that were it not for
the bright yellow of the excavators
and the omnipresent fluorescent
waistcoats I might have believed it
an etching of some grim Victorian
salt mine.
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Their fingernails were cracked and
dirty, their voices were hoarse and
their words often gave way to ragged
bouts of coughing. I had not
previously considered that there
might be any need of mask or
respirator but shortly after my arrival
I found myself surreptitiously
holding my handkerchief to my
mouth and nose, if only to lessen the
pervasively acrid smell.
The foreman, a spritely young man
whose weak moustache gave him
the air of an overambitious school
prefect, was talking excitedly about
the engineering of the building,
about struts and sheets and material
loads but when I asked him how long
he expected the dome to stay up. He
went quiet for a moment, then told
me he wasn’t sure. “Could be there
forever!” he said, with an odd manic
edge to his voice. “Or it could be
gone in a year. You just… never
know. Do you? You never know
what’s coming.”
Something about the way he
articulated this thought, this clearly
disordered conception of the future,
sat rather ill with me. I began to
develop another suspicion, that the
contaminants of the place were not
simply chemical in nature, but may
have contained a more psychical
poison.
To be clear, had that been the extent
of what I observed I would not be so
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

vociferous in my opposition to Dr
Welling’s proposal. Unfortunately, it
very much was not.
Following my guide’s strange
comments, I began to hang back
somewhat from the rest of the group,
attempting to make my own
determinations without the
consideration of being watched. I
espied a worker operating one of the
concrete mixers that arrested my
attention. He was of East-Asian
descent, Pakistani I believe, and his
face was locked on the aperture of
the mixer, spinning round and round
as though hypnotized by the motion.
There was no-one else in sight, and
it seemed to me as though the din of
industry and construction had faded
somewhat, like it were muted as he
stood in his senseless reverie.
Abruptly, he turned and walked over
to a nearby ditch that was in the
process of being dug out for the
foundations. I could see the tell-tale
indications of heavy metals in the
earthen edges of it, but he took no
precautions as he hopped down into
it and began to stare at the wall of
the trench as transfixed as he had
been at the mixer.
Were I writing for a less learned and
experienced audience I might take
some time here to caveat my
reliability and sanity, but given none
of us are strangers to the
strangeness of our work I will speak
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

plainly of what I saw for the sake of
brevity.
From the dirt of the wall emerged the
same man as was standing before it.
He clawed his way out slowly,
painfully, as though it were a grave
but this second version of the
worker was not identical. His hair
was white, his skin wrinkled and
pitted with age and illness and his
every movement slowed with the
agony of infirmity.
Were I to guess, I would say he was
some forty or fifty years older than
the man with whom he was twinned.
The younger version, for his part,
seemed to break out of whatever
reverie had overtaken him, with an
expression of purest terror crossed
his face.
He moved to scream, but before he
could utter more than the most
perfunctory of cries, the older, or
perhaps newer version of him
depending upon one’s perspective,
covered the original’s mouth with
gnarled and twisted fingers.
Despite his, or perhaps its, apparent
age, this elderly copy was clearly
possessed of enormous strength,
and was easily able to pull the young
construction worker towards the dirt
wall from which it had emerged. The
struggle was grim and desperate, but
not particularly lengthy, and in less
than a minute both had vanished into
the polluted ground. The last thing I
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

saw of them both being the poor
young man’s horrified eyes
disappearing into the darkness and
mud.
I rejoined my guide without comment
and had no other encounters worth
noting here during my visit beyond
the general malaise induced by the
site of which I have previously
spoken.
It should be clear enough, then, why
I felt compelled to write in opposition
to Dr Welling and his team’s
proposal to become involved with
the Millenium Exhibition and the
Dome that is to house it. It is my firm
belief that not only is this site
already on its own journey to
become a decidedly hostile locus,
but that the future it represents, and
that we are being pushed to
incorporate into our grand ritual, is
unfit being so profoundly and
irrevocably poisoned.
I thank my brethren for their time
considering these letters and wish
them insight in their works.
3. INT. OIAR OFFICES – NIGHT, DRIZZLING (COMPUTER)
ALICE sits in front of SAM’s computer.
ALICE
You bastard. You wanted him to read
this, didn’t you? Just slipped it into
his caseload, all subtle like and
[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

waited for him to hear it. Well not
this time.
ALICE deletes the case despite the computer’s objections.
ALICE
(leaning close)
I see what you’re doing. Trying to
lead him on, feeding his obsessions.
Colin was right about you. What do
you want? Hmmm? Who’s in there?
The computer is silent.
LENA
Alice?
ALICE
Ah!
LENA
May I ask why you are investigating
Sam’s terminal?
ALICE
Oh er, Sam was having an issue with
it earlier, same errors as mine and
since Colin’s still not around I
thought I would give it a quick go,
see if I couldn’t copy Gwen’s
solution for him.
LENA
I see. And I presume that Sam
consented to your intervention?
ALICE
Oh er, yeah. Yes.
LENA

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Well regardless he really shouldn’t
be sharing terminal access like this.
It’s a security risk.
ALICE
I’ll er- let him know when he gets
back.
LENA
Please do. In the meantime I would
suggest you return to your own
terminal. We wouldn’t want these
technical issues to put you behind
your own caseload now would we?
ALICE
(moving seats)
Er yeah, sure. Can I er- Can I speak
freely for a moment?
LENA
Do you ever not?
ALICE
Fair but look, serious talk a moment,
we’re going to struggle to keep on
top of everything without Colin.
Everything keeps breaking and we
don’t know the first thing about
fixing it.
LENA
Interesting. If anything my data
seems to indicate the system is
actually functioning slightly better
without his interferences.
ALICE
Oh well I don’t know about that.
LENA
No. You wouldn’t.
[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Beat.
ALICE
Well, I should probablyLENA
Have you heard from Gwen tonight?
ALICE
What? No. Why, should I have?
LENA
It’s nothing. I simply wondered if you
had heard from her tonight. She is
late returning from her assignment.
ALICE
Somethings up. You look worried.
You never look worried.
LENA
Only about your caseload after all
these interruptions.
ALICE
(unconvinced)
Of course.
ALICE gets back to work.
LENA
(departing)
Do let me know if Gwen
contacts you.
ALICE
Will do.
LENA departs.
ALICE CONT.
(to computer)
What did you do?
[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Freddy pings obnoxiously in response.

4. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ABANDONED WAREHOUSE – NIGHT,
DRIZZLING (GWEN’S PHONE)
Gwen is running hard, her breathing is ragged as she hits the
exit door of the warehouse and plunges out into the alley
behind. She stops, looking around frantically.
INK5OUL
(pursuing)
Come back little canvas…
GWEN
Get away from me!
INK5OUL
What to give you? I’m thinking trash
polka, but I’d never want to impose
my own taste on a client…
Gwen starts running again. She starts to dial into her phone, but
fumbles it, and we (listening through the phone) tumble to the
floor. Gwen picks it up again and starts trying to dial again.
GWEN
Shit. Shit!
INK5OUL
You sound like someone who might
have a family crest. Maybe we could
riff on that? Or perhaps a silver
spoon done across the face?
Gwen is running again. Ink5oul is having a great time.
INK5OUL
Choices, choices…
[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Gwen rounds a corner to see a man in the distance, lighting a
cigarette.
GWEN
Hey! HEY!!
BYSTANDER
Hm?
GWEN
Help! You’ve got to help me!
The bystander immediately focuses on Gwen.
BYSTANDER
Woah, woah what’s up love? Calm
down, are you alright?
GWEN
(panting)
Trying… to Kill me… Call…
Ink5oul rounds the corner.
BYSTANDER
(to Ink5oul)
Oi you! Back off.
Ink5oul laughs quietly.
BYSTANDER
(cont’d)
I’m warning you!
INK5OUL
Nice ink. Barbed wire is that?
BYSTANDER
What?
INK5OUL
Boring but not badly done. Looks so
sharp you could cut yourself…
[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

BYSTANDER
Wha-AAAAAHHHHH!
The tattoo begins to saw through the bystander’s arm. His arm
drops to the ground. Then so does he, still screaming.
GWEN
Oh god!
GWEN drops her phone.
INK5OUL
Don’t worry. We’ll get you something
much more… unique.
Gwen takes off running, disappearing into the rain. Ink5oul
follows, chuckling.
The phone finally gives up the ghost.

5. EXT. A BACK ALLEY – NIGHT, DRIZZLE (TAPE RECORDER)
A tape recorder clicks on in an empty back alley on a miserable
night.
Eventually running feet approach before GWEN slams into a
chainlink fence.
GWEN
(panting)
No! Nonononono!
She looks around desperately for an escape but finds nothing.
INK5OUL
End of the road, Princess Civil
Service.
GWEN
Please… Please don’t…
INK5OUL
[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

You know, when you first walked in, I
was just going to give you a bit of
ink. Something small to keep you up
at night. But now? Now we’re going
to have to get creative. Tell me, how
do you feel about scorpions?
They grab Gwen’s arm, and she starts to gasp in pain as ink
begins to seep onto it to the distinct sound of scorpions.
Ink5oul laughs but then Gwen begins monologuing, the words
pouring out of her unstoppably like a river. She is alarmed but
cannot stop.
GWEN
(Compelled)
When I was a little
girl there was a shed
at the bottom of the
garden that I was
always told never to
go inside. There were
tools and sharp and
deadly things-

Ink5oul
What- What are you
talking about?

What are you doing?

-that were not right, too
dangerous for a little
girl. But then one year
we lost the gardener to
another house and the
new one brought
everything they needed
in the van so the shed
was locked up tight-

Alright stop! Stop it!
Enough I said.

Shut up!

-and sealed against any
nosy children who
would think that
something in there
might be rusty toys for

Shut!

Stop Talking!
[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

playing without the fear
they needed-

A Figure emerges, shrouded in a cloak of whispers.
GWEN
(Compelled)
-at what damage such
sharp metal can inflict
on uncareful flesh-

INK5OUL
You did this.
Well stop it, she’s mine.

The Figure continues to emerge, a nightmarish specter of an
older world, slowly enveloping Ink5oul’s brash bravado.
GWEN
(Compelled)
-it took no more
than the smallest
push to break it
open and inside
spilled out
teeming swarms
of writhing bonewhite maggots
GWEN
(Compelled)
flesh poured
forth from the
rotted fox that
must have come
in through the
window seeking
warmth not
death

INK5OUL
No I found this
one.

[ERROR]
MINE.

[ERROR]
ALL OF THEM, MINE.
INK5OUL
Dammit fine!

[23]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Ink5oul reluctantly releases GWEN. She sprints away still
gabbling as she flees.

GWEN
(Compelled)
-instead finding
only putrescence
seeping
squirming
reaching for me
as I-

INK5oul
Go get her
then.

The Figure does not move.
INK5OUL CONT.
Didn’t you hear me freak? She’s all
yours.
Beat. The Figure turns to Ink5oul.
[ERROR]
THERE IS MORE.
INK5OUL
Not here there isn’t.
The Figure breathes deeply, a strange and disconcerting sound,
enveloped in pained whispers.
[ERROR]
NO. NOT HERE. ELSWHERE…
The Figure recedes.
INK5OUL
Yeah, whatever. Manky old git.
Beat.

[24]

©Rusty Quill 2023

INK5OUL
(reaching to the tape
recorder)
Oi, you left your- Argh! Mother FuThe tape recorder bites Ink5oul before clicking off.
