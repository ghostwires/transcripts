[Intro Theme]
ALEXANDER J NEWALL
Hi everyone, Alex here to pep you up
with Big Cable Knit Jumper Energy.
Now, some of you might not know
this, but after a long hard day of
brutally murdering your favourite
characters, there is nothing I like
more than sitting down in a big
comfy armchair and enjoying a nice
hot cup of Fluffy-Wuffy-uwuNonsense-Juice.
Now I know what you’re thinking:
“Alex, the world is dying, held
hostage corporate greed and myopic
self-interested political leaders. I
don’t have time to check in on my
favourite blorbo skrunkily twink ship
drama! I’ve got go eat the rich!”
And I hear you, I really do. Eating the
rich IS important. But so is self-care.
And sometimes you’ve got to slow
down to smell the flowers. So, with
that in mind, we wanted to give you a
little something to help you out. A
soupçon of silliness to send you on
your way.
And so we present to you this
lovingly crafted season one bonus
fluff episode, affectionately titled
“Plenty More Fish”, which is full to
the brim with positivity like
friendship, love, and …punctuality.
And is guaranteed completely

organic and free from artificial
horrors.
So, while you are waiting for your
Amazon Basics Guillotine to arrive,
why not sit back, relax and enjoy a
taste of our delicious nonsense.
[Sip]
mmm… yum.

1. INT. THE PUB – EVENING, CLEAR (COLIN’S PHONE)
The pub is quiet, but not empty. COLIN is sat drinking.
ALICE enters.
ALICE
There you are! What happened to the
usual table?
COLIN
Already taken.
ALICE
What? How are we supposed to
mope about in the corner when we’re
in the middle of room? The vibes
here are unconducive to bitterness.
COLIN
Yeah, well tough so sit your vibes
down and get drinking, already. Got
you a pint of your hipster piss.
ALICE
IPAs aren’t hipster, Colin, they sell
them in Tesco.
[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023

She sits.
COLIN
Almost thought you weren’t going to
show.
ALICE
And miss the chance of seeing you
moaning into your pint? Never!
COLIN
It’s a better listener than you.
ALICE
True, bet it hardly ever calls you a
sour old wanker with no taste in
women or drink.
COLIN
Harsh but fair.
ALICE
Speaking of…
Alice raises her glass.
ALICE
Merry divorce!
COLIN
And a happy piss off!
They clink their glasses together in cheers, then take a sip.
ALICE
What is it now, three years?
COLIN
Four and twelve.
ALICE
Still living the bachelor dream?
[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

COLIN
What dying alone? That’s the plan.
ALICE
Is your next of kin still that hard
drive where you keep all your porn?
COLIN
Oh, you think it’s just the one? Poor,
naïve Alice. So young, so foolish in
the ways of love. Speaking of ALICE
(Sighing)
And there it is. Go on then, take your
shots at poor little Alice.
COLIN
It’s been, what, a month now?
ALICE
About that.
COLIN
I still can’t believe you got him the
job, after everything you said.
ALICE
Hey, moaning about exes on
Divorcemas is just what you do. He’s
actually a good guy who just needed
to catch a break.
COLIN
Sure, sure. Must be hard for you
though All those unfamiliar human
feelings bubbling to the surface…
ALICE
EW. Are you trying to upset me?

[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

COLIN
Aye.
ALICE
Then you up your game, Becher,
because I’m a stone-cold emotional
fortress.
COLIN sees SAM entering the pub.
COLIN
Oh good. Then you probably won’t
have a problem with what’s lurking
behind you.
ALICE
What?
SAM
(distant)
Alice! Colin!
ALICE
Oh god.
COLIN
Alice. What is Sam doing here?
ALICE
I, uh…
Sam comes up to the table.
SAM
Heya! Am I early?
COLIN
No. Did Alice invite you?

[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Uh, yeah? She said you were having
a “divorce party”, which I assumed
was just her way of saying a bit of a
booze-up, so…
COLIN
You see, Alice. This is what happens
when everything that comes out of
your mouth is a sarcastic joke?
People get confused.
SAM
Oh, ah. Listen, if I’m intruding I can-.
COLIN
You’re here now. What’re you
drinking?
SAM
Uh, IPA, thanks.
Colin snorts slightly, then gets up and heads to the bar. Sam
sits.
SAM CONT’D
Alice?
ALICE
Ok, so… Colin’s been divorced a
couple times, and as part of some
bizarre cosmic joke, both of them
ended up being finalized on the
same day of the year. So he and I,
we’ve kinda got this little tradition
now where on that day, today, we get
together, get pissed and uhSAM
And?

[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
And bitch about our exes.
SAM
Oh.
(realizing)
Oh.
I should go.
ALICE
Too late for that, Colin’s already
gone to get you a drink. You duck
out now, and you’re as good as
dead.
SAM
Sure butALICE
I wouldn’t worry, he loves to see me
squirm so I’m sure he’ll have a great
time.
Colin returns, setting Sam’s drink down in front of him.
COLIN
Here you go.
SAM
Thanks.
Colin sits.
COLIN
Drink it.
SAM
Er… okay.
Sam sips.
COLIN
Well go on then.
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Sorry?
ALICE
(reluctantly)
I think what Colin is trying to say is
that as the newest member of this
particular bitchy subcommittee you
have to spill on your exes.
SAM
Um, ok… So, uh, there was this girlALICE
I’m right here.
SAM
Hey, I’ll have you know I have plenty
of exes!
ALICE
What, like actual humans?
COLIN
Get on with it!
SAM
Right yeah, sorry. So her name was
uh Kelly and she worked at my old
office, in HR.
COLIN
Red flag.
ALICE
(smirking)
Did she make you sign a form?
SAM
She was nice.
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
That’s not what I asked.
SAM
She… may have needed us to
declare a potential conflict of interest
butCOLIN snorts
SAM CONT.
But that wasn’t why we split up.
COLIN
Christ, what was the reason then?
SAM
Oh it just didn’t work out.
Beat.
COLIN
Right.
ALICE
(faux conspiratorial)
Listen Sam, if you’re going to hang
with the Mean Girls you’re going to
have to do better than that! What
sucked about her? What obnoxious
habit did she have, what drove you
up the wall and made you want to
gnaw your arm off?
SAM
Oh I don’t know…
COLIN sighs, bored.

[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM CONT’D
Oh actually, she had this weird thing
where, when she laughed, her
tongue came like all the way out of
her mouth. It was so weird, I can’t
really do it, it was like… Hahahaha
He imitates it, badly.
ALICE
Ew!
COLIN
Now we’re talking.
SAM
Right? And she was into old black
and white comedies. You know,
Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers,
that kind of thing.
ALICE
I mean that’s annoying sure butSAM
(getting into it)
No, I mean, she was really into them,
as in every date was round her place
watching old movies and every time
we ended up… uh…
COLIN snorts.
ALICE
I’m sure you looked very fetching
dressed up as Charlie Chaplain in
stockings and handcuffs.
SAM
What No! it was nothing like that!
He thinks for a second.
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM CONT.
Although, she did ask me if I smoked
cigars and seemed a bit
disappointed when I said no.
ALICE
Oh Sam. My poor little oblivious
baby shrimp.
SAM
I’m telling you it wasn’t like that, we
were just talking abo- Oh my god.
ALICE
(eager)
What?
SAM
She bought me a bowler hat.
ALICE
I’m sorry. What do mean she
“bought you a bowler hat”?
SAM
(sheepish)
It was a gift. She said she thought I’d
look good in it.
COLIN
(chuckling)
I bet she did.
ALICE
Amazing.
SAM
It’s not like I wore it out on the street
or anything, just once or twice
when… well…
COLIN laughs
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Oh Sam. I know you think you want
normal, but I think it’s pretty obvious
that deep down you only go for the
truly depraved and bizarre.
COLIN
Sounds about right.
ALICE
Damn skippy.
SAM
Well what about you then eh? I’m
guessing it was non-stop horror
stories when I wasn’t on the scene.
COLIN
Mate, you have no idea. You’re a
well-adjusted, genius, alpha-male
heartthrob compared to what Alice
has been dating.
ALICE
I’m not that bad.
COLIN
Oh no? So you’d be happy to hang
out with Amy again then?
ALICE
Look say what you like about AmyCOLIN
(interrupting)
All right I will. She was a psycho who
got you mixed up with your own
brother and then stabbed him for
being an imposter.
SAM
I’m sorry what?
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Ok, Colin is exaggerating. She barely
broke the skin and, in her defense,
she was very high at the time.
SAM
Jesus…
ALICE
Obviously we broke up after.
COLIN
Yeah a month after.
SAM
A month? Jesus Alice…
ALICE
As I was trying to say earlier: “say
what you like about Amy but she was
a fabulous lay.”
COLIN
My theory is Alice can only get off
with people who are properly batshit
y’know. Like, oh god what was his
name…
ALICE
(wearily)
Ignatious.
COLIN
That was it! Bloody Ignatious, the
man who was being hunted for the
secret to cold fusion.
ALICE
Okay in my defense, he didn’t tell me
that until the second date.

[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

COLIN
Sure because he was too busy on
your first date explaining how he
might need to go “off grid” because
he was being pursued by… What
was it he said.
ALICE
(sighing)
“Despicable Agents of numerous
foreign powers”.
SAM
And there was a second date?
ALICE
He could have been a sexy
superspy!
SAM
I mean, I don’t know how super he
could be if he told you that on the
first date.
ALICE
Oh, stick it up your bowler hat.
COLIN snorts
ALICE CONT.
You have no idea how bad it is out
there for a trans woman with basic
standards.
COLIN
Aye, so if I meet one, she’ll have my
sympathies.
They all laugh.
ALICE
You’re up Becher.
[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Oh yeah, this is your divorce party or
whatever, isn’t it? So go on then,
weirdest hook-up?
COLIN
I don’t hook-ups. I mostly just hate
people, marry them then divorce
them.
ALICE
Speaking of, you’re about due to
drop down on one knee again aren’t
you? I’d watch out if I were you
Sam…
Sam laughs nervously.
COLIN
If I’m on my knees near any of you
lot it’ll be because I’m finally rigging
the entire place to blow with you
inside it.
ALICE
Charming.
SAM
(laughing)
Alright then, how about the first
marriage. What happened there?
COLIN
He cheated on me with my manager.
Had been for a while.
Beat.
SAM
Shit.

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Right, sure, tragic. A terrible breach
of trust and all that, blah blah blah.
But that’s not the real reason, is it
Colin?
SAM
Alice, come on you don’t need to ALICE
Colin?
COLIN
I… might have been sort of, maybe,
looking to break it off anyway for a
while.
SAM
Oh yeah?
ALICE
Because…
COLIN
(sighing)
Because he was turning into a
crypto-bro.
SAM
(laughing)
I’m sorry what?
COLIN
Oh yeah, laugh it up! You try living
with someone when they fill the flat
with bloody graphics cards running
non-stop. He never put towards the
energy bill and every conversation
was just another lecture on bloody
blockchain or “blobcoin” or
whatever the latest bullshit doing the
rounds on reddit was.
[17]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
That does sound… a lot.
COLIN
Yeah. So when I caught him messing
around with Clive I dropped his
Cypto Wallet in the bog, took a
dump, then flushed.
(smiling)
Last time I checked that shit would
be worth about 1.2 million now.
SAM
Jesus christ….
COLIN
Yeah.
ALICE
And that Sam, is why we celebrate
this most holy of days. To drink,
moan and remind ourselves that it’s
absolutely the right decision to die
bitter and alone. “There’s plenty
more fish in the sea…”
COLIN
“And they’re all covered in their own
shite.”
COLIN and ALICE drink deeply.
SAM
Mmm. Well, I don’t know if I’m quite
at your level yet. Still got the heart of
romantic…
ALICE
Oh we’ll cut that out of you and burn
it on the altar as a sacrifice to the
gods of messy breakups.
[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
I see. And would the high priests of
heartbreak accept a pair of pints as
sacrifice instead?
ALICE
I suppose they could be convinced
to lightly amend our dread litany…
COLIN
Just as long as it isn’t any of that IPA
piss.
SAM
(standing and heading to
the bar)
Of course your holiness.
Beat.
COLIN
I expect a full report on him next year
after you wreck your life reopening
that particular scrawny can of
worms.
ALICE
Bite me.
COLIN
No thanks. Vegetarian remember?
ALICE
Then go suck a carrot or something.
COLIN
I wish I could Alice. I really do.
