1. INT. OIAR MAIN OFFICE - NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER).
SAM sits doing some paperwork.
His pencil breaks.
SAM
Dammit.
He stops, sighs stands and walks over to an old, mounted crank
sharpener.
He begins using it.
LENA enters.
LENA
Problems?
SAM
Just a broken pencil.

LENA
(Approaching)
I see. And what exactly is this you're
working on anyway?
SAM
(returning)
Just some response department
paperwork.
LENA
(leafing through)
You are aware that the response
department hasn't existed for some
years now?
SAM
Well yes but…
LENA
I am afraid it looks like our
colleagues are entertaining
themselves at your expense.
SAM
Sorry?
LENA
I’ve seen this with other new hires.
Some ill-conceived initiation rite.
Alice's doing, I suspect.
SAM
Ok, uh… Thanks for the heads up.
SAM sits and returns to the paperwork.
LENA
What I am trying to say, Sam, is that
this paperwork is unnecessary.
Meaningless.
[3]

SAM
I understand. But I think I might see
how far down the rabbit hole goes. If
it is AliceLENA
I am sure it is.
SAM
-I want to see how long she can keep
it up for.
LENA
(nonplussed)
So long as it doesn't interfere with
your work.
SAM
Oh, I’m doing it strictly off the clock.
SAM continues with the paperwork and LENA observes him for a
moment.
SAM CONT.
It's actually sort of comforting in a
way, you know?
LENA
I can assure you, I don't.
SAM
There’s just something very zen
about filling in pointless forms now
and then.
LENA
I see.
(she doesn’t)
Beat.

LENA CONT.
Well as engrossing as this must be
for you, I believe your shift has
started.
Beat.
LENA
Sam.
SAM
Mmm? Oh yeah, sorry.
SAM puts the papers aside then begins his computer work.

POST #1: Finding My Piece (20-0618, 19:31)
Hey all, A here. First off, thank you
so much for all the help over these
past few months. I can't express how
insightful, patient and open minded
this community has been. I never
thought I'd find others willing to help
me create a better me like this so...
sincerely thank you.
Anyway I'm going to be documenting
my journey here and wanted to start
by asking how you all went about
finding your piece. I've been thinking
[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

it over for a while now. I even caught
myself saying it to myself into the
bathroom mirror at work. Someone
overheard me and thought I was
talking about finding peace, like
inner peace, and asked if I was
meditating. Kind of ironic, really, but
I don't think they'd get the joke.
Anyway, I’d love to know how others
found their piece. Or I guess my
question is more, does it matter?
Should it be important? Should it be
meaningful? Should it be random?
Am I overthinking it? Looking for
thoughts and advice. I'm going to
take this all the way so will take all
the help I can get!

POST #2: Found it! Alnewman86 (1307-18, 18:52)
I think I've found it. My piece. Maybe
I knew where it was all along. I'm a
bit worried though because to get it I
have to be a bit... Sneaky? Nothing
too bad, but I'm nervous. . There's
this restaurant I eat at all the time or rather I used to eat at all the time and I guess it's significant to me. It
was where I said yes after Anthony
proposed (those who have read
some my previous posts know how
THAT turned out) but it's also where
I first realized that I had to do this.
They have this massive aquarium
and I remember just suddenly
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

realizing how serene everything was
inside. The water was crystal blue
and at the bottom there it was...
vibrant, electric almost and... so very
alive. (God knows how they got it all
through customs)
I remember the first night coming
home after that. Anthony was
snoring beside me, and I couldn't
stop thinking about that aquarium. I
didn't really know what I was
searching for, I didn't know how to
articulate it. It's a feeling I'm sure
many of us here know very well and
so as I tried to unfold my thoughts...
I stumbled upon... well, you guys! :)
So yeah, that’s going to be my piece.
I've already spoken to a waiter who's
agreed to let me in the back
tomorrow night after closing while
they're cleaning up in the kitchen. I
have my container and I've read all
the steps in the How-To Forum. I just
wanted you all to be here with me, to
experience it. So... Wish me luck!

POST #3, I think I'm just about ready
Alnewman86 (14-07-18, 20:48)
I'm parked in across the street
waiting for the last customers,
thinking about what this place meant
to me, back then, what would've
happened if things had been
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

different. Not that I'd have it any
other way.
His voice was so loud for so long it
drowned me out of my own life. I
wonder if any of you have felt it? The
way other people try to convince us
that we can better ourselves by
being more like what they want. But
we can become someone new.
Someone better. Someone the pain
can't touch... Anthony would never
understand the difference. He
couldn't.
I wonder how many people in that
restaurant right now are still stuck
like I was?
I'm just killing time so happy to chat
it through, if anyone wants (at least
until the waiter arrives!)

I can't believe it! My heart is still
racing! I've never done anything like
this before. Never stolen, never
cheated... I feel alive for the first time
in my life.
I’m staring at my piece right now. It’s
on my desk, I want to keep it warm.
I’m going to sleep holding it tonight
like you all suggested, so it’s
properly bonded with me before
tomorrow... It is safe, right? Of
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

course it is. I’m overthinking it. Will
be back tomorrow, right before the
full moon!

POST #5, First Cut Alnewman86 (1607-18, 19:22)
Took today off work. Sleeping
beside the coral, my coral, my
piece… I slept better than any night
next to Anthony, better than any
night ever. The best sleep of my life.
I’m so ready to be whole.
I even had a dream last night. I was
back at the restaurant, looking at the
aquarium while Anthony prattled on.
I was staring, aimlessly, at the lights;
the colourful stones, the green of the
moss on the stones that hugged the
Coral... when all of a sudden, I was
alone. And…
I was afraid. I span my head around,
looking for Anthony, for the waiter for anyone. Then I saw her. On the
other side of the Aquarium. We
locked eyes for just a moment.
Like I said, I want to share every part
of this for anyone who wants to
follow in my steps. I know some of
you like the dream interpretation part
of it and I wanted to share.
But I'm ready. I have my rubber
gloves, I've sanitized the scalpel as
LazerCat23 suggested, I have a clean
working surface, bags, bandages
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

and my sewing kit for after and... and
I am nervous.
I know what I need to do, and I know
it will all be worth it.
Will update right after. Here we go.

Alnewman86 (16-07-18, 21:17)
I’m a bit out of it but I promised I
would update: Feeling a bit woozy
but it's done. My thigh bled a lot
more than I expected, you were right
burntumberJ. I have tomorrow off
but I have to go back to work while
she starts to grow. I can't wait… I
can see her, under my rippled skin.
Waiting to grow. She's perfect…
She's everything I wish I could've
been.

POST #7, My Secret Alnewman86
(26-07-18, 15:34)
I've been at work for a week now and
it’s so different. It was difficult to go
back to "normal" knowing she was
inside me but here I am, actually sat
at my desk with her pressing against
my thigh skin. I keep catching myself
running my fingers under my skirt
just to feel her pressing up beneath
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

my skin; living, breathing polyps
gently moving through my leg. A life
that I hold within my body and
nurture. Anthony would never have
understood, it’s not the same as
some squealing baby. I'm so glad
he's gone and like you've all said she
and I, we’re becoming one… and
then two.

POST #8, My Secret - Update 1
Alnewman86 (18-08-18, 22:03)
Hey all. I know it's been a few weeks
since I've updated. I'm in the early
parts of stage 2 and I'm here to
confirm it is terrifying. It started with
my feet, I noticed in the shower one
day that I couldn't feel the hot water
on them... it was so strange at first
but I knew what was happening
thanks to your advice. It's up to my
waist now... no feeling whatsoever.
I'm on bereavement leave from work
for the next bit then I have some
vacation days saved up. I have the
humidifiers set high, the curtains are
taped shut and everything I need is
within reach. I know any day now my
second stage will properly begin.
I'm terrified. I'm exhilarated. It's
really happening!
Wish me luck!

POST #9, My Secret - Update 2
Alnewman86 (27-08-18, 10:13)
It's started. Last night, I heard it
while laying in bed... It's exactly as
described. I couldn't feel a thing,
nothing, but then the skin broke with
such a distinct sound. Like cutting a
half-inflated football. Then I saw the
red blossom out through the white
sheets.
She’s so beautiful, bright pink, and
radiant! The coral polyps blooming
and scattering from the broken flesh
over my feet and legs with such an
incredible smell, like sea water, sand
and copper.
It's slow though, much slower than I
would've thought….
Oh, and I managed to rent a
paralysis computer. Great
suggestion again burntumberJ. So I
should be able to keep everyone
updated as planned, even when my
arms start to go.
I cannot express how great it is to
finally see her... to finally meet her
out in the world at last.

I had the dream again. I was in the
restaurant. I was alone and I met her
eyes. She was me. She was with me
that first night. She was always with
me... but now she's arrived. She's
here. I'm awake.
She has my eyes.

POST #11, She’s almost here
Alnewman86 (01-09-18, 09:04)
Last night I watched my stomach
unzip. The skin stretched then tore
cleanly. There was only the blood. It
was beautiful but it took forever. I
keep thinking of this life I'm leaving
behind. I’d love her to keep my
name. But I don’t know if she will. I
know I shouldn't be, but I'm scared.

Alnewman86 (01-09-18, 18:33)
I'm having difficulty swallowing
fluids now. My skin is wet with sweat
and mold.
Alesis Newman is leaving this world
and whoever comes next, though
she may look like me in some ways,
though she may carry a part of me
with her, she’ll be better. Free of all
my mistakes.

[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Perhaps people will like her more
than me. I already like her more than
me.
I want to see her walk off happy and
strong. I hope she doesn’t feel this
now, just be the good parts of me. I
hope it’s like I dreamt, I hope she has
my eyes…

Alnewman86 (03-09-18, 02:22)
Writing with my eyes now. The last
parts of me float away. She lays
where I lay but she is not me. She is
strong. She is graceful. She is bright
in mind and color and I love her,
more than I thought I could love
anything.

3. INT. OIAR BREAKROOM - NIGHT, CLEAR (CCTV)
SAM enters the room and prepares coffee with a yawn.
CELIA
(yawning)
Oh great, you’ve got me started.
SAM
(deliberately yawning)
Soooooorry.
CELIA
(yawning again)
Stop it!
Sam chuckles. He finishes preparing the cup and sits next to
Celia.
SAM
Anything good tonight?
CELIA
Another evil toy. That’s like 6 this
week.
SAM
If I could give you my weirder ones I
would.
CELIA
Aw thanks!
(she sips)
Oh speaking of, did you have any
luck?

[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Hmmm?
CELIA
Those names I gave you. You find
anything?
SAM
Nothing useful. Jonathan Sims is
pretty generic as names go. And I
didn’t have much luck with Martin
Blackwood either. There were two
that were close to the right age…
CELIA
But?
SAM
But they died, separately, nearly
twenty years ago. cycling accident
and some kind of heart thing. No
connection to the Magnus Institute.
As far as I can tell they never even
met. Where'd you say you had found
them?
CELIA
Couple of old documents. I must
have got the wrong end of the stick.
I’ve had a bit of luck elsewhere
though.
SAM
(perking up)
Oh yeah?
CELIA
I think I’ve found the right Basira
Hussain and I have a lead on a
Helen...

SAM
Richardson?
CELIA
That’s the one.
SAM
Fantastic! When can we go talk to
them?
CELIA
Okay hold your horses GWEN enters, clearly upset.
Beat.
She begins to make coffee, sees it is empty then begins making
more.
SAM
(quietly to Celia)
Don’t…
CELIA
Shhh.
(to GWEN)
Care to join?
GWEN
I'm fine.
SAM
(sipping)
Glad to hear it.
CELIA
Gwen… it’s okay if you need a bit of
help now you’re back on cases-

down)
I said I'm fine.
Beat.

Told you…
CELIA
All right then.
(to Sam)
Shall we?
SAM
God yes.
They exit.

4. Int. OIAR Breakroom night, raining (CCTV) – SCENE
CONTINUES
GWEN recommences making coffee only to drop a mug.
Beat. It feels like she is about to explode.
Instead she cries, small and quiet.
Pause.
ALICE enters.
ALICE
So I hear you’re back to your normal,
pleasant(noticing)
Oh. Ah.
GWEN
I'm fine. I dropped my mug.

ALICE
I can see that.
Pause.
ALICE takes over preparing coffee while GWEN steadies herself.
ALICE
I had a favorite mug. It said “love you
bitch” and had a picture of drunk
dog on it. Luke got it me with the
cash from his first gig. Sam broke it
by accident last month. I nearly fed
him the pieces…
Beat.
Alice helps pick up the pieces.
ALICE CONT.
Is it really that bad being back in the
muck with the rest of us?
GWEN
It’s not that.
ALICE
Oh yeah?
GWEN
You wouldn’t understand.
ALICE
Probably not, but I'm as good as
you’re going to get here. Especially
when you keep biting everyone’s
heads off.
Beat.

GWEN
(deep breath)
Lena… She’s been sending me out
to deal with people… things.
Beat.
ALICE
Okay.
GWEN
And well… they’re… weird.
ALICE
Weird like a… lobster in a hat weird
or…
Beat.
GWEN
I think I have an idea where our
cases are coming from.
ALICE
(suspicious)
What are you saying, Gwen?
GWEN
(cracking)
I thought maybe we were meant to
be documenting them, keeping them
monitored or under control, but- but
then the Externals started turning up
in the caseload after I gave them
instructions andBeat.

GWEN CONT.
Last time it was this tattooist. I was
meant to be recruiting them only…
things didn't go well Alice. They
went bad. Very bad.
ALICE
(serious)
Go on.
GWEN
They- It- well it turned on me. And I
mean really turned on me. It was
going to kill me Alice. It killed
someone right in front of me and I
was... it was ready for me next. Butbut then another showed up.
ALICE
Another what?
GWEN
Another thing. Another ‘External’. At
least I think it was. They faced off
and… I ran.
ALICE
God. What did the police say?
GWEN
What are you talking about? The
police? Alice this wasn’t some
random mugging! These… things.
They’re awful, horrific. They aren’t
human.
ALICE
And Lena knows this?

GWEN
(bitterly)
Oh she knows. She just doesn’t care
enough to warn us.
Beat.
GWEN CONT.
You don’t believe me.
ALICE
After what I’ve seen here over the
years? No, I am totally ready to
believe Lena would rather hire literal
monsters than pay a decent wage.
Beat.
ALICE CONT.
Sorry. No wonder you’ve been so
arsey.
GWEN
I’ve not been “arsey”ALICE
So this “other” external. Why did it
intervene?
GWEN
I don’t know.
ALICE
But like how did you know it was an
External?
GWEN
Because I know how many eyes a
regular human is supposed to have!
It just stood there holding this old
tape recorder and-

A tape recorder?
GWEN
Yes.
