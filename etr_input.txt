NEMO
Hello. Welcome to the fifth episode of Below Decks where we dig into some of
the research questions, stories, and generally tangential interesting things that
went into making Trice Forgotten. I'm NEMO, my pronouns are they them. And
I'm the creator and lead writer of the series. This is coming out after episode
six of the podcast lay day. So we've just delved more into Alestes past with Anh
and Gammon and we've had the ships crew taking care of an ill and ailing
Alestes. Fittingly, today we'll be talking about queer found families of color and
I'm thrilled to be joined by Helen Gould. Could you introduce yourself with your
pronouns and tell us a bit about what you do slash your relationship to this
show?

HELEN
Hi. Um, my name is Helen. My pronouns are he, she and they in no particular
order. Okay. My relationship to this show is I do play a guard briefly.

NEMO
Hell yeah. Strongest role

HELEN
Vital. Vital. Vital to

NEMO
Yeah. Yeah. I mean that Guard later. Oof. When we get to them. Oh my God.

HELEN
Such a character arc. I'm also Rusty Quill’s head of inclusion. And on the side I
am a writer, editor, sensitivity consultant, all that kind of stuff.

NEMO
Amazing. So yeah, today we're gonna have a hopefully fairly fun question about
queer found families of color. I say fun with that voice because we started
talking about our topics beforehand and we were like, Ooh, how messy is this
gonna get? So I guess the first like framing question is, Helen, do you have
some pieces of media with queer found families of color slash doesn't have to
be of color just yet, either or both queer found families that you particularly
enjoy watching, listening, reading.

HELEN
I mean I am, I am fairly deep into our flag means death fandom at the moment.
Yeah. Which I'll definitely call queer found family, some of color, some of not.
Mm. Does that make grammatical sense? It doesn't matter. that, that is very on
topic cuz that's pirates as well. Yes,

NEMO
It is very on topic

HELEN
And there are lots of different relationship both romantic and platonic in that
show that I really, really appreciate. Okay. Spoilers for our flag means death.
Mm-hmm. , obviously there is Stede and Ed, there is Lucious and Pete, there's
Alu and Jim and everyone else has lots of d My head just went, there's the
Scottish guy in his seagull. Well, I don't think that counts.
NEMO
Um, that's a queer found family if I've ever seen one

HELEN:
,
NEMO
He takes care of those seagulls like family. Yes. More than family.

HELEN
Yes, it's true. I think one of the things I would like to, to raise about that is that
one of the very interesting things about our flag means death is that people are
in different genres essentially. Like black beard enters and is sort of part of sort
of a typical dark pirate drama kind of thing, but very quickly adapts to Stede
and the rest of the, that crews more sort of sitcom kind of ways. And then
when Izzy turns up, Izzy cannot adapt to that. And so Izzy is always trying to
drag Ed back into dark drama, cutting off people's toes kind of thing. And I
think that's a really interesting contrast, I guess because as well I'm, I am I am

thinking of this like completely on the fly. I think that is an interesting contrast
because there also is these days often a tension between sort of light and fluffy
queer narratives and darker more complex nuanced queer narratives. Yeah. So
it's interesting that we have both of those really happening in that show
though obviously very heavily leading towards comedy. I don't know if that
answers your question at all in the slightest. Yeah.

NEMO
It was, uh, what queer found families do you, are you currently thinking about?
So that's yeah, you answered it. I I really like our flag means death, I mean
obviously, and one thing that I really liked about it is the, like the side
friendships of all of the like side characters mm-hmm. mostly the characters of
color who are like supporting each other. Yes. One thing that I have liked about
Our flag means death is that just as the, the queerness is never the butt of the
joke, the race conversations have never been the butt of the joke. Mm-hmm. or
Whiteness is the but of the joke in all of those scenes and the like pyramid
scheme episode

HELEN
I really liked that

NEMO
It was so good and it was just, I mean I was talking to my friend about it and I
was like, there are multiple black male characters who talk to each other and
support each other. Yeah. Like, that's also not something that you see in things.
Like, it reminds me of when Brooklyn 99 was coming out and Stephanie Biros,
who plays Rosa Diaz was talking about how she heard that Melissa F. Romero

had been already cast as Amy Santiago and she was like, Oh, well I'm not gonna
get the role then because there's already one Latina actress in the show. So
there can't be two of us in the main cast. And yeah. The idea that yeah. The
token thing of like, oh, there's one of us in the show, so that means that there
can't be any others of us. Cuz there can't be plurality in ideas of what Asianness
means or blackness means between huge communities of people.

HELEN
Yeah. Have you, have you watched any of, um, the L word’s Generation Q
NEMO
I haven't.

HELEN
Okay. All right. I just finished watching the second season of that in the past
couple of days. And that's really interesting because it's still, it's still
problematic in some ways mm-hmm. , but it is also clearly an attempt to
address some of the much more problematic things from the original L Word
series. Mm. Again, I dunno if you've seen that.

NEMO
No, I haven't. But I've heard interesting mixed things about it. I mean, it, I feel
like it comes into that thing I get of what you were saying about like what queer
media like exists of like whether it has to be like irreverential comedy or super
serious a 24 film.

HELEN

I mean the interesting thing about the L words that it is nice, it's, it's more of a
soap opera ah, than anything, but it changes depending on what season you're
looking at. So in the original L word, the first season is really like, it feels really
indie and interesting and kind of like a cult TV show. And then once that came
out, I think they probably got a lot more funding and stuff. They commissioned
a whole theme song, which I hate but is really catchy. . But the L word is set in
LA Okay. And the vast majority of the principal cast is white in that original
season. There's Bet who is mixed race, There's Kit her six, her sister who is not
mixed race, um, who is, um, played by Pam Greer. There's Carmen who is
Latina, there's the person Bet has an affair with Chantel maybe is what she's
called. Um, there's Tasha who's black and I think that's almost it.
NEMO
Oh.

HELEN
Of, of a series that went like it went for six seasons. Um, They also had, um, uh,
they attempted a story about like, uh, transition and transness and um, had
this character Max just treated awfully like very, very badly. And he ends up
getting pregnant and it's a whole horrible thing. And it's like, the point is
there's a lot of issues with it. And I think that the reboot with Generation Q
very much tries to address that because they again have a trans man character
played by a trans guy, Leo Chang, I think his name is. Mm. And some of the
main relationships are between women of coloUr and there's a lot more sort of
consideration of that. And there are entire conversations in Spanish or in Arabic
I think because there are, there are, there are whole two Persian characters. ,
Whoa. .

NEMO
Um, oh my gosh.

HELEN
That also I think counts for me despite the various kind of problems with it in
the second season, it does start to really tackle with some of the ideas around
race because some of the characters from the initial run, uh, in or in this as
well, so Bet is still there. And she has, uh, a daughter called Angie who is much
more sort of visibly black than Bet is. And they actually have a conversation
about this, about how this means that, that they travel the world in very
different ways. Mm. I think Bet says something like, you know, I, I understand
that, you know, white people sometimes assume that I'm Italian or whatever
mmhmm. and Angie's donor is a dark skinned black man and there's this whole
conversation about how Angie wants to meet him and that's important to her
to see people who do actually look more like her. And anyway, there's a lot of
really interesting in depth stuff there. And you know, there's literal family
dynamics going on there because we're following Angie who was born in the
first run and everyone was like, Oh my gosh, she's going to grow up with a
whole host of like queer moms. It's gonna be great. And she has turned out
pretty well. I'm very proud of Angie.

NEMO
That's, I I'm glad , I I was thinking about the intergenerational thing. Yes. And in
my brain, like trying to be like below deck. Okay, trice forgotten. How can I link
this back? I'm a host, that's what my job is. But, and I was thinking about the
intergenerational thing and I think it's, someone pointed out that within like
the first seven minutes of the first episode of trice Forgotten, you've already

got two queer black people talking about their queerness as slightly tangential
to the story, but not really. And they are of the generation above our
protagonists. So it's Baker and Elizabeth both talking about Yeah. And how
Alestes has been brought up in a very queer environment of be, I mean the
stereotype of a a a found family narrative is that an orphan is brought up
among like a rag tag group of people. But that is how Alestes was brought up.
And um, in Lay Day we started to see Yeah. And in Gammon’s part of that
mm-hmm. and how that's often, I don't know, like in, in trice forgotten. It's a
kind of point of contention for alestes. It's not always a positive thing or that
she's had multiple influences from quite a few people who consider themselves
her father figure and that she has to deal with that. Yeah. I, I, I think for me the
idea of Queer Found family also comes from this desire to see queer older
people taking care of younger queer people. Cause that is not something that
we, we, that was broken because of the AIDS crisis. Yes. And was, and is
continuing to be broken by this like idea that certain demographics of queer
people have to stay among themselves. And, and we've kind of shifted this idea
of like hegemony to like, if you are this, then you have to stay with this group of
people. And so when Yeah, there's no real path I guess. Or we've broken the
path for queer people to talk to younger, queer people. And so I'm like saying
this and realizing at the same time that I'm like, Oh yeah, it's nice that Alestes
at least does have like, queerness is not something that Alestes has to worry
about because the people that she grew up in and around gave her that
knowledge.

HELEN
I feel like maybe part of what you're saying there is that if we are relating this
to like real life and modern times and such, I feel like there is a big gap of

understanding from maybe some of sort of the younger queer generation
about how different things were even in the nineties to how they are now. And
obviously we've still got so, so far to go, but I cannot imagine having explicit
queer relationships in kids' cartoons and I was growing up Mm. Um, yeah, that
that, that would just be unheard of, especially. Um, and when I was at school, I
think Section 28 was still in effect for at least some of the time I was at school.
And that is where, um, teachers were not allowed to tell you about the gays.
Mm. Because obviously children could not be the gay.

NEMO
Yeah. Yep, yep. Yeah. That would be unheard of.

HELEN
Yeah. But obviously I knew since I was in like year five and I had a crush on my
teacher

NEMO:

HELEN
It is also interesting thinking about how in real life as well, like you, I don't
know if you've experienced this but isolated when I was at school, whereas like
the people who are, you know, sort of misfits from the typical what seen as
norm do tend to gravitate together.

NEMO
Yeah. Yeah.

HELEN
Yeah. I think, I think what I'm trying to say is it was rough. It was rough growing
up, um, in the nineties, even though that was only 20 years ago. Yeah.

NEMO
Uh, yeah.

HELEN
We've come such a long way. Like it was such a big deal for people to come out
back then. Yeah. And I, it, it still is a big deal for people to come out, but it's
much more common. Mm.

NEMO
Yeah. I was talking to my cousin who is just turned 18 and like, I came out as
trans to my family and to be honest, it wasn't like super horrific or anything. I
was fairly lucky. Um, but I know that her parents are very, were the most like
on the fence about it. And my cousin has just started using she and they
pronouns on Instagram and Snapchat and all of the TikTok. And I'm not that
old, but I sound so old when I'm like, hand the talk . Uh, and, and I was like, Oh,
you know, if you ever wanna have a conversation about gender, if you ever
wanna like, you know, if you ever need some advice or anything. I've been out
to our family for like 10 years now, like, can fully support you. And they were
like, All right. I Was like, if when I was your age I Would've killed to have
someone in our family who was also trans. Like I don't, or, or nonbinary. And
I'm like, I'm so glad that that is the case for them, that they were like, Oh, it's so
offa now to be non-binary. Like I'm only 27. And for me, like the huge shift

between growing up there is that huge shift that has happened even in the
couple of years just below me. Yeah.

HELEN
I get what you mean. I am, I'm so, so happy for the younger generation, but
there's also a part of me that's like, hold onto this. Mm. Because it can be taken
away and people are trying to take it away. Like, and, and so if you don't know
that you have to fight for it, then you can easily lose it.

NEMO
Yeah. And like when I was thinking of things to say on this episode, I was trying
to think of like queer found families and, and how that was influential I guess to
my writing. I was like, that's surely something that might come up. And I was
like, what were my favorite films? I was a kid and it was Lilo and Stitch and I
really loved Lilo and Stitch Cause it was about two siblings who had to care for
each other and then a whole group of people who were older than them but
were alien to their way of life. Were trying to help them survive, but were just
so clueless. And, and so it was a lot of like give and take and a lot of the like,
you know, Lila and Nanny having to grow up too early and be allowed to be
children or being allowed to have fun because they gradually come to trust that
these people around them are genuinely there to take care of them and feel
like the, the idea of allowing yourself to be taken care of is a huge thing. . Oh

HELEN
Yes. . I think so. And I think, I think that's a really important cuz I, I don't know if
you can ever feel completely taken care of if you are constantly keeping like a
big secret from a parental figure. Mm. Yeah. So like, I'm still not out to my mom

like in like any of the ways. Mm. Some of my cousins know or have guessed I
told my dad and uh, he literally took that to the grave. So we'll always be
grateful for that

NEMO
Uhhuh.

HELEN
But it's like, there's, there's a barrier there that your parental figure doesn't
know is there, and you have to hold that by yourself. And I think that there
must be like such a freedom in not having to do that or not feeling like you
have to do that. Yeah.

NEMO
And I like to imagine that the characters and Trice Forgotten. Most of them
have never had to bear the weight of being in the closet in a certain way
because they do live in, in this world that I've created for them where being out
is not something that they really have to worry about. But one, because they
didn't feel like that was particularly interesting to rehash too because, you
know, expanding the idea that it was really 19th century scientists creating the
idea that, you know, queerness was bad. Mmhmm. , there were other things as
well. Buddhism was also a big influence in, in East Asia about like creating these
sexual roles as well. So oh blah fluidity and gender and sexuality. But when you
do grow up in fairly traumatic places, like Alestes has the idea of like also losing
people that you suddenly now care about is a huge thing I would say. And
allowing yourselves to love them and like forming attachments is very scary.
And I feel like that's also something that doesn't really get talked about

because most family narratives in the, like cis he kind of way, even though they
might talk about like families breaking down, you still have that like, oh, well
they, your blood, you, you have to, you should, you will always love them in a
certain way. But it's, so I feel like it's so much scarier the concept of losing
somebody that you really, really do care about but is not , uh, contractually
obliged to always love you back .

HELEN
Yeah. Yeah. I think that there is never any guarantee of a person loving you or
for always. ever and ever. Yeah. Um, but I think that queer people have to deal
with that a lot earlier and a with a lot more, um, uh, seriousness than set
people often do. Mm-hmm. like the idea of having to go no contact or low
contact with one's own family just because of something about who you are
that you can't change. Mm. I think it's a very painful one because a lot of the
narratives that you see around sort of mainstream family dramas Mm. You
have to have actually done something or your parent has to have actually done
something to have, have driven you away. Mm. It's not about an inherent part
of your being. Mm. I'm not quite sure what I'm trying to say there, but I guess
I've tried to say that there's like a, a fragility Mm. I think often in terms of being
queer in a family and I think that's one of the reasons why queer found family
is such a big thing.

NEMO
Yeah. Yeah. Because

HELEN

Cuz I would actually say the opposite of, I mean, you said, uh, contractually
obliged to lovely , but, but, but like they're not, Yeah. And to me it actually feels
safer to depend on people who are, who are not related to me because it
means that they chose to know me and they chose to enter into this
relationship with me. And so there is something that feels stronger to me than
not doing it out of duty. Mm.

NEMO
Yeah. I I I always find it, it, it's interesting and I, I feel like the, these things do
heighten our attachment to the idea of the queer found family. I saw a tumble
post recently, um, by a user called quasi dash normalcy and it reads, it probably
goes without saying, but found family trope is so popular because so very many
people are so terribly, terribly lonely. Um, and I, yeah, it made me oof quite
hard. But the idea of having to find people who will make your life less lonely is
unfortunately something that many, if not all queer people of color can
understand or empathize with. Yeah. And someone was talking about how like
in ballroom culture in the eighties in, in New York, so mostly black queer
people in eighties in New York creating houses for each other and becoming
mothers, becoming fathers, becoming siblings of other queer people who
didn't have a home anymore. Yeah. And so making those houses for each other
and those things can only exist when something as terrible as every one of
these people have lost their family exists. And so yeah. I feel like the queer
found family does, um, speak to a lot of queer people because it's probably
something that we've already started to do in some way Yeah. With our
friends. Um, yeah, , I, I did see . I was on, um, a walk with my friends the other
day for a forest and um, , we have a friend who's very, like, he, he tries to be
very serious, so he's very like serious only wears monochromatic colors and,

but we know that he's soft on the inside. And so we started saying that he has
whimsy in his heart. And since then I've just started being like, Oh, we love you
and we love your whimsy. And it just makes me really, uh, soft and warm I
guess thinking about those kind of moments in my life where I have these
friends where I can be like, Wow, I feel so much joy hanging around this with
these people and I feel like I could rely on them for anything. And we'll see
we've the trice forgotten characters, they're not there yet. They're not at
cooling giving each other whimsy, but they're certainly, uh, that's certainly
hopefully where they're headed. Hopefully I say as if I'm not writing the show.

HELEN
Well, do you never know. Characters often surprise me.

NEMO
Yeah, that's true.

HELEN
You have reminded me, I can't remember her name unfortunately, but there
was lesbian women during the AIDS crisis. So basically a lot of the time men
were sort of forcibly outed to their families once they contracted aids and that
was how they got sort of disowned and abandoned and there was this one
woman who, who buried them all Basically.

NEMO
Yeah.

HELEN

And I, I think about her a lot. Yeah. And I think about there are just, there are
lots and lots of stories about the lesbian community looking after gay men
during that time Yeah. And having to step up because nobody else would. Yeah.
Because you know, nurses would refuse to touch them or because funeral
homes would refuse to have them. Yeah. And I think as well about, um, have
you seen It’s a Sin?

NEMO

Yes they have.

HELEN
Yes. That also makes me think about queer found family as well, because that's
literally what they

NEMO
Do

HELEN
Yeah. In that house,

NEMO
The like solidarity mm-hmm. and the, the decision that we are going to care
about each other. Yes. Especially because other people aren't. And that gets
really frustrating when it's really hard to do. Yes. I'm thinking about trice
forgotten now. I'm not thinking about AIDS crisis that felt like I need to be clear
about that . But yeah. That that people are still people and can be very

frustrating unless these, um, but that we are going to decide to care about
each other, which is what's so frustrating about, uh, Ran coming about the L G
B Alliance in the uk Oh. Who are like, they call themselves a charity and they
call themselves like sticking up for lesbian and and gay rights, but are like purely
a, a fascist

HELEN
Yeah.

NEMO
Hate group. And the idea like they, they really are just trying to tear people
apart. Mm-hmm. , they did a study recently and they basically were trying to
force trans people to start hate messaging about lesbian women and loads of
lesbian women were like, No, , like, you don't speak for US LGB Alliance go
away. Yeah. It makes me so emotional when I do see cisgender lesbian women
speaking up for transgender rights and I shouldn't be like, I shouldn't be
emotional about the fact that like there is Intercommunity alliance and
Strength, but anytime I do see like, especially older white women, because
unfortunately that is also the demographic of like

HELEN
Ery Yeah,

NEMO
Exactly. That. I'm like, how have we got to the point where it's surprising to me
when queer people stick up for each other?

HELEN
Yeah. There's always been, like I say, there's always been sort of
intercommunity tensions. Yeah. I think for me, one things that's most
frustrating about the L G B Alliance and all their various sock puppets and
followers and that is that there's really not that many of them. They just are
very loud and post a lot. They're way, way, way more averse than there are of
them. Yeah. And you know, I mean it maybe it's easy for me to say because I'm
not, despite being sort of gender fluid slash non-binary, I don't think of myself
as trans

NEMO
And I,

HELEN
I'm still that stage where I'm like, Do is, is that something that I can claim? Am I,
am I under this umbrella? Is this something that I can say? But um, I'm, I'm not
a person who is at the forefront of being threatened by all of This.

NEMO
My small caveat here is the same thing I said in a previous episode, which is
there is space for anyone who wants to call themself transgender. There is not
a limited amount of places. So if you would like to come under the umbrella
term you can and you should, but you shouldn't. Like, you know, but you don't
have to. But yes. Um, that is my caveat for anyone at any point who is like, Oh, I
like, I don't know whether I'm taking off space. And it's like, it's not like a one in
one out system. You don't have to shoot someone in order to be allowed to use
the, the the name. It's

HELEN
Not a physical space.

NEMO
Yeah, exactly. And you know, you can always decide that you don't like the
word and all of those kind of things. So Yeah.

HELEN
There's nothing wrong with the word.

NEMO
Yeah. Yeah. It

HELEN
Just, the experience is associated with it are not ones that I have to me. Yeah.
And so it doesn't feel like something I can claim. Yeah. Uh, this is one of those
things where it's like I would be saying exactly the same thing to you if you
were having these questions, but what, when it's me it's different. Yeah,

NEMO
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I

HELEN
Can't remember what we were talking about before, but I think, I think the
upshot was turf spad and less relevant than they think they are.

NEMO
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, it wasn't in the last episode, but in the, the
episode before that we've um, finally introduced Inez, who is every single
episode that Raf and I do about the low decks, we're always like, Oh, we wanna
talk about this character, but we can't. And then the first episode that Inez is
here, Raf isn't in the episode. So I'm gonna talk about Inez who is in
contemporary parlance, parlance, parlance whatever French gender fluid
mm-hmm. gender queer uses. He, she, they any pronouns and , one of their
first lines when they arrive is, Hey, we're all family here. Right. And Siva has no
understanding of what that means. Yeah. Because Siva has never, Siva doesn't
comprehend, I guess queerness it. My little egg who um, hasn't really
conceptualized his own queerness yet, I would say. Or I mean Yeah. Whereas
Ina is coming in strong with the, like if I had the word trans, I would be using it.
And again, the crew of the Wanson respect enes gender identity entity while
also hating Inez personality.

HELEN
I really like Inez. I haven't listened to episode six, but I did hear episode five and
I love hearing someone be so self confident in themselves. Yeah. And I am very
interested to see what's, what their relationship with Siva like, what, what
influence they might have.

NEMO
getting Inez a sticky little fingers all over Siva. Hell yeah. Exactly. I I think
actually on an episode of Enthusiasm that I was on with you, um, about anime,
I was talking about one of my favorite anime is called Barakon. And it's not an
explicitly queer genre, but it's a genre where a self-hating young person gets

like, uh, exiled to the countryside cuz they're a city slicker and they meet a
community of people, community in the small town kind of way who care for
each other and care for this new person. And city slicker is like, Oh God, I've
only lived in cities my entire life. Why is everyone being so nice to me? ? And as
someone who's only grown up in London my entire life and who genuinely
does get surprised anytime I go north of London and people are like, Hi, how
are you doing? And I'm like, Who are you ? Why are you being nice to me? I
feel like that's also an influence in Trice Forgotten where I'm like, hmm. People
who like are nice to me for no reason other than human beings started off as
tribes who, uh, needed to be part of a community to survive, discuss.

HELEN
Yeah. I actually I have this pal who he often says to me, You're very
understanding . And in fact my boyfriend often says that as well. And I'm like, I
don't, I don't know how else to be. And it's, it's ironic that the fact that
someone is telling me that I'm very understanding is something that I don't
understand because like I, I feel like it's, it, it to me being understanding is
absolutely the default. Yeah. It is incredibly easy for me to put myself in
someone else's shoes. Mm. And so it always baffles me when people don't do
that.

NEMO
Yeah. There was, someone said something the other day, and I can't remember
the exact quote and I can't find it. It was something like a study that was done
where if you are questioning something, you can't be judgemental because
there is something in your brain. Like if your brain is in learning mode and
querying mode, it prevents you from being judgemental. And so the idea that

you can always be, I really wish that I had the quote because it really, for me
was kind of like a epitomized, tries forgotten, which is the characters who
question things. But in a, like I'm questioning the world around me because I
want to learn more about the world around me. I'm curious, you can't be
judgemental if you're being curious, I think was what it was. Ah. And if you are
curious about the people around you and you are attempting to understand
them, like, and you don't have to understand someone to be empathetic, but
all of those kind of things, like you are opening your mind to the fact that your
mind is continually growing. Whereas if you are consistently in a state of like
stoic, static judgemental, what I know about the world is what the world is,
then you are not, you are not being curious until you're not growing in a certain
way. And I just thought like, oh I really like that because you can see and trice
forgotten. The characters have stopped being curious and the characters who
who are. Yeah.

HELEN
And that does make a lot of sense cuz if you think you've got everything sorted
out, why would you ask any questions? Yeah, for sure. Yes. I guess I am always
very aware that I do not know everything.

NEMO
Yeah. I mean it's that thing of education as well, right? Like the higher you go in
education and I'm always feeling this, uh, that that idea that like, the more you
know, the more you know you don't know and the more you realize that, oh
God, there's so many people out there with so many other interesting ideas
and like yeah, you just, it's always that big fish small pond Yeah. Conundrum.
And

HELEN
That's actually, that's so that's a wonderful thing. Yeah.

NEMO
A really lovely,

HELEN
There's always something else. Yeah.

NEMO
And this world is so full of possibilities and potential guys, even though we've
talked about the turf and we've talked about all of the bad queer things that
have been happening and we've lamented the youth having a world that we
didn't grow up in . Um, it is really great and queer found families who are really
excited about talking about snails that they found in a rock pool because they
feel safe with each other and they're not gonna mock each other for feeling
enthusiastic and excited and happy , unless you have anything else you would
like to say on that point. I feel like that's a fairly nice place to end this episode.

HELEN
I will say that you reminded me of a quote that I recently retweeted. Well, not
a quote, it was just a tweet. Um, , it was a girl, not to be rude, but the world is
so abundant, no shade, but despite the suffering life is a tremendous gift. And
that's something that I feel very much,

NEMO

That is an amazing place to leave this episode. So, Helen, if people wanted to
find you for more thoughts about your beautiful Mind, Oh, and I forgot to say
also the best Rusty Quiller, where can they, where can they find you?

HELEN
People can find me on Twitter at alecto101. That is a l e c t o1 0 1 though
mostly all I do though is retweet. So if you actually wanna hear from me, you
should go to my Twitch, which is twitch.tv/HelenRosamund, where I'm
currently doing Baron Breakfast. But hopefully we'll get back to Mass Effect
soon.

NEMO
Amazing. Thank you so much for joining us. So that's it from me, Nemo, and
goodbye from Helen.

HELEN
Bye!

NEMO
And we'll see you next time Below Deck!
