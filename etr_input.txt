Yeah.
CATHY:
If you hear it done wrong, you know, <laugh>, it's not right. It's usually very static or the, the tempo is
off. So it sounds like ; Tip, tip, tip, tip, tip, tip. Like if we're running and it's really not <laugh>, somebody
has gotten like their coconuts going and it's not working.
KATIE:
I mean to add to that, the challenge specifically with Trie is we have two layers of removal from the
world that we're familiar with. Geographical for most of us and historical. And I've spent quite a lot of
time cause this, I think this is my first historical production. Listening to what I've got and trying to
decide whether that rumble is traffic. Cause my ears are so used to having the traffic sounds. I almost
dunno what it sounds like when it's not there.
CATHY:
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
NEMO:
Yeah.
KATIE:
You know, so sometimes you, I've been able to source sounds from Sri Lanka, which is authentic
geographically, but I'm there going, is that a car?
CATHY:
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
KATIE:
And, you know, is, is that enough of a car that I can EQ it out or am I gonna have to go and find
something without a car? In which case it's the middle of nowhere and that's what, what I need either,
you know, and, and then you find we are building up with multiple layers. Some of the ambiances I've
been building, like in if episode three I had, oh I think 15 different layers of ambience
CATHY:
mm-hmm. <affirmative>.
NEMO:
Oh my gosh.
KATIE:
Cause I was having to construct it in a much more kind of from first principles kind of way, you know?
And that's, that's without all the sound effects and the vocals on top of it, you know, So
CATHY:
