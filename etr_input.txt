ANNOUNCER
This episode is dedicated to Alicia.
During early lockdown in 2020, Alicia
listened to a lot of The Magnus
Archives, a source of fantastical
scares that gave her temporary
reprieve from some very real horror.
Among many terrifying episodes,
those specifically centering on meat,
on the juxtaposition of human and
animal bodies, the callous suffering
of slaughterhouses, and other fleshy
things, resonated with her. She
reevaluated her relationship with
food. She wondered what the
difference was between a family
member and a beloved dog, between
that dog and a nameless factory
cow. She decided to become
vegetarian, and hasn’t looked back
since. Many thanks to the creators of
The Magnus Archives for using their
art to inspire change in Alicia’s life!

Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus
Protocol.
Episode Twenty-Seven – Driven
[Music]
1. INT. OIAR OFFICE – NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
SAM is sat typing his desk, humming contentedly whilst LENA
and GWEN fret around the office.
LENA
Whose is this?
[2]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GWEN
Whose is what?
LENA
This shelf. Whose responsibility is
this shelf? Sam?
SAM
Hm?
LENA
Whose files are those? On the
shelving unit behind you?
SAM
I don’t know. Colin maybe? Why,
what’s up?
LENA
It is a cluttered eyesore.
SAM
I’m sure Colin can sort it when he’s
feeling better.
LENA
If Colin returns to this department it
will be long after the Minister’s visit. I
want this resolved now.
SAM
It's just some files…
LENA
It is not “just some files”. It is a
symptom of a disorganized office
and an excuse for the minister to
insist upon additional oversight. You
will move them into the stationary
cupboard at once.

[3]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
I mean I could, but then I’d have to
stop processing cases and you were
pretty clear you wanted the entire
caseload dealt with so…
LENA
Gwen?
Beat.
GWEN
(restrained sigh)
I’ll deal with it.
LENA
Very good. Check in with me once
you’ve finished.
GWEN
(still restrained)
Of course.
LENA exits to her office.
GWEN
(cont’d to Sam)
Thanks for that.
SAM
Look I honestly wasn’t trying toGWEN
Oh, don’t give me that, you’re loving
this! you’ve been sat there grinning
all night.
SAM
Have I?
GWEN
Yes.
[4]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Maybe I just woke up on the right
side of the bed this evening?
GWEN
Well, whatever it is, it stops now.
SAM
Um, I don’t think you can order me to
stop being in a good mood…
GWEN
I can, and I am. It’s putting me on
edge.
SAM
(not sorry)
I’m so sorry. In that case, I’ll do my
best to get bitter and cynical.
GWEN
Good. This should help.
Gwen tears a piece of paper out of a notebook.
SAM
What’s this?
GWEN
Your extra duties.
SAM
I thought you were sorting it?
GWEN
I am. By delegating them to you.
He starts to read, unimpressed
GWEN
How’s that good mood doing?

[5]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Struggling. Look, I’ll see what I can
do but I really do need to clear my
caseload first.
GWEN
(mollified)
All right then. Now, do you know
where Alice is? I’ve got a special list
for her…
SAM
Now who’s grinning? Breakroom I
think.
GWEN
Excellent. Carry on.
GWEN exits.
SAM
(calling sarcastically)
You’re welcome!
Sam looks at the list again, groans slightly and puts it on his
desk. He resumes typing and triggers the next case.

2. CYBERSPACE – N/A, N/A (CASE READING)
AUGUSTUS
February 18th 1845
It is with some trepidation that I am
forced to record yet another failure,
as despite my certainty that none
beside myself will read these words,
I must be mindful of my becoming
disheartened, and strive against any
loss of conviction. While I have no
[6]

©Rusty Quill 2023

hesitation in accepting N’s
recommendation, the particulars of
the collapse must be confronted
directly. We have been undertaking
this great work, perhaps the greatest
work, for nigh upon three decades
and thus far are still unable to effect
transmutations beyond those
endeavors we each undertook alone.
We have some dozen of the finest
minds of the age, yet it seems more
wont to stagnate our thoughts and
progress than to light within them
that muses’ fire of inspiration.
Is it perhaps the need for secrecy? Is
the clandestine nature of the
researches we attempt in its very
nature opposed to the work of both
natural and unnatural philosophy we
have undertaken. Or is the spiritual
aspect of our alchemical undertaking
such that only the experiments of an
individual can ever bear fruit?
No, I must excise such doubts from
my mind. Purification is not only to
be found in chemical processes,
after all. We had all of us reached the
limit of what might be achieved
alone. If such were not the case, the
Institute would not have been
founded, nor would my fellows have
selected me for its leadership, much
less its name. I must hold fast and
continue my explorations.
February 22nd 1845
A curious thing has caught my
attention. It is strange how the work
[7]

©Rusty Quill 2023

of natural philosophy attunes ones
eye to the things that might be
termed unusual. I was making my
way to our London offices when I
heard the din of a crowd
approaching from a nearby corner.
The shouting of slogans and waving
of banners marked it immediately as
a Chartist meeting and, not wishing
to receive another sermon on the
necessity of reform and the urgency
of radical constituency changes, I
moved to hail down a carriage. At my
call, two stopped close by each
other: a somewhat worn-looking
hansom cab, and one of the newer
Clarences, one of those which my
housekeeper calls, in her inimitable
way, a “growler” due to the sound of
its wheels on the cobbled streets.
As I was travelling alone, my natural
impulse was toward the speed of the
hansom, yet the din of the meeting
made my reconsider, as I have often
found the heavier wood of the fourseater Clarence to make for a quieter
journey, as least within the coach. I
was certainly in no rush, so I took a
step towards the cab with every
intention of engaging it, when
something stopped me.
There was only a single coachman.
Not so unusual, perhaps, but
something about the manner of his
sitting gave me pause. He looked
straight forward, paying no heed to
myself or anything else in the street
that might call his attention and he
[8]

©Rusty Quill 2023

wore a long oilskin greatcoat which
draped over the entirety of his body,
despite the dryness and
unseasonable warmth of the day. As
I slowed my step, my eye began to
take in more precise detail of the cab
itself. The colour seemed unusual
somehow, the glossy black glinting
like a bottle-fly, and the joins in the
wood seeming smoother and less
angular than perhaps they should
have been. There was even a sheen
on the plush red furnishings, almost
as though they had become wet
somehow, and I could not shake the
oddest sense of disquiet when
looking at it.
I had no opportunity for further
examination, however, as my
momentary hesitation had been
noticed by another prospective
passenger, who promptly stepped
ahead of me into the Clarence. It
began to move away immediately,
and as it did so two things became
apparent. The first was that the very
instant the door closed, there was no
longer any sign of the passenger
within the carriage, and it seemed
once again empty. The second was
that as he pulled away the
coachman’s greatcoat was caught
briefly by a gust of wind, and in that
moment I saw without doubt that
there was no border, no dividing line,
no gap between the coachman and
the coach. They were somehow as
one.
[9]

©Rusty Quill 2023

If this is as I suspect, I would be wise
to keep an eye open for this vehicle,
restrict myself to hansom cabs and
try to forget the unnerving sound the
“growler” made as it moved away.
February 26th 1845
I have found it again. It took far less
effort than I suspected it might, as I
believe that it relies on the ubiquity
and variety of cabs speeding around
London for its anonymity, rather
than the actual verisimilitude of its
disguise. Indeed, the longer one
considers it, the clearer it becomes
that neither it, nor the coachman, nor
the so-called horses that feign to pull
it, are at all what they appear to be.
I espied it once again upon the exact
same street where it had nearly
caught me, and I have no wonder as
to the reason. It is dense with traffic
and few pause their step or make
note of the specific comings and
goings. I suspect it is a more than
adequate hunting ground.
Upon sighting the thing, I hailed
down a separate cab and bid it wait,
pointing at the Clarence and telling
the driver to follow it when it should
have a passenger. He gave me a look
that I might uncharitably describe as
insolent, but it took little extra coin
to secure his goodwill and thus
cooperation. I then watched as a
well-mustachioed young gentleman
in a brand new frock coat flagged
[10]

©Rusty Quill 2023

down and entered my quarry.
We followed behind for almost an
hour, leaving my nerves frayed from
the constant rattle of the thing
moving over the cobbled streets and
my driver’s near-constant
aggravation. It did not stop, nor
slow, nor discharge its passenger,
but after some minutes I began to
notice a subtle, but unmistakable
hint of crimson in the ruts it carved
through the muck of the London
streets, as though fresh dye were
leaking from the joints of the rolling
wheels.
At length it disappeared into a
covered alleyway. By this time
evening had fallen, yet the
lamplighters had not been about
their duties, and my own coachman
was adamant that he would take me
no further after such a frivolous
chase. So it was, I left the safety of
the cab and continued on alone,
creeping into the darkness with
naught to brighten my way. I took
what comfort I could in the
knowledge that if I could not see,
then I could not be seen, though it
helped me little as I was now
possessed of an unspoken certainty
that the growler had no need of eyes.
I consider myself fortunate that the
coach-thing was not waiting for me.
Instead I soon found that the
seemingly derelict alley was instead
full of small, discarded scraps of
[11]

©Rusty Quill 2023

clothing, as well as old newspapers
and even an umbrella. And of
course, the freshest and least
decayed of these was a frock coat,
though I could not in any sense still
describe it as brand new.
There is more to learn here. Perhaps
my recent frustrations with our
progress and the increased scrutiny
by Boyle’s incessantly meddling
inheritors have pressed me to put
more significance on this than is
warranted, but I cannot help but feel
that to understand this thing may be
to finally unlock the world as yet
unknown to us. And in pursuit of
that, there is no cost too great.
March 2nd 1845
It is done, and I am surprised to find
how little remorse I feel. I have
retrieved young Archibald
Cameron’s notebook, and found it
surprisingly legible, if somewhat
soiled. It is no great loss to the
Institute, though I shall not be too
open with the others as to the cause
of his disappearance. He was the
youngest of our number and
certainly the least skilled, which
endeared him to several whose
hearts are in my estimation too soft
for the great work.
Even so I was taken aback by how
little dissembling it took to convince
him to enter the growler and make
observations. I naturally made no
mention my nigh-certainty that the
[12]

©Rusty Quill 2023

journey would be fatal, but in almost
all other particulars I was honest,
even to the point of speaking to him
plainly that I could not guarantee his
personal well-being. Still, he was
eager to assist in the scribing of
those notes I had emphasised were
potentially vital to the advancement
of the Magnus Institute’s work.
Likely, he was simply overawed by
my status as founder, but his
excitement at this prospect was
clearly genuine.
For all his youth, I am impressed at
Archibald’s conscientiousness,
writing as he did so far into the
process, albeit with some trouble
towards the end. The final few pages
are naturally of a more frantic and
pained character, but they also
contain some of the most useful
observations. To his credit, his
philosopher’s eye was calm and
accurate even in his final moments.
Well, perhaps not his actual final
moments. His analytical faculties
begin to desert him shortly after the
loss of his skin, and it is clear from
the handwriting exactly when his
eyes depart his skull. This seems to
have occurred some minutes after he
finally accepted the doors were truly
impossible to open and in turn
seems to have prompted his last, but
perhaps most important deduction:
that the rate of digestion, for lack of
a better word, seems to be linked to
his own levels of fear. Ironically this
discovery itself clearly caused him a
[13]

©Rusty Quill 2023

great deal of that particular emotion
since the rest of his notes were little
more than pained scribbles and
crude invective. I believe his final
lines were cursing me specifically,
but his penmanship, already so poor,
was rendered truly unintelligible by
this point.
My surmise that a paper notebook
would not be digested or consumed
has proven accurate, reinforcing my
belief that the consumption process
is supernatural, rather than
chemical, as there are no biologic
stains other than the blood smears.
Sufficed to say, if the contents of
this notebook prove true, it may
indeed prove transformational to our
researches. That such beings exist,
and not simply as myth beyond the
fringes of civilisation, but within the
very heart of our great empire, may
yet prove as important as any
transmutation taking place within an
alembic. And if there are things of
such horror already in this world,
perhaps our great ambitions are not
quite so foolish after all. Time will
tell, I suppose.
3. OIAR OFFICE – NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
ALICE and GWEN are busy at their desks. It is tense and ALICE
is clearly in a foul mood.
There’s a ping as Gwen receives an email. She opens it.
GWEN
Hm.
[14]

©Rusty Quill 2023

Beat.
GWEN
(cont’d)
Alice?
Beat.
GWEN
(cont’d, irritated)
Alice.
ALICE
Sorry, I can’t hear you over the
sound of me polishing all the break
room knives.
GWEN
For goodness sake that wasn’t even
on your task list.
ALICE
No, but it’s important if I’m going to
properly murder-suicide, you, Lena
and the useless pain-in-the-ass
minister when he arrives.

GWEN
You know it’s illegal to joke about
killing an MP?
ALICE
You know it’s illegal to be a
completeShe takes a breath.
ALICE
(cont’d)
What do you want Gwendolyn?
[15]

©Rusty Quill 2023

GWEN
You ever get any weird emails?
ALICE
I’m openly trans on the internet.
GWEN
At work, I mean.
ALICE
(interested despite herself)
Not really. Why? What’ve you got?
GWEN
It’s just some old files, but the email
address looks like gibberish. I’d ask
Colin, but he’s… y’know…
ALICE
Careful.
GWEN
Indisposed?
ALICE
Yeah, well, I don’t know what you
want from me. I’m hardly a computer
whizz myself.
GWEN
Hmm.
ALICE
What are the files?
A pause as Gwen clicks into some of them. Her demeanor
abruptly shifts, becoming secretive.
GWEN
Just… junk. Old paperwork. Nothing
important.

[16]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
(suspicious)
Right. Let’s have a look. You know
me, I love unimportant old
paperwork.
GWEN
Sorry. Already deleted.
ALICE
(dubious)
Oh yeah? Fine, whatever, I’ve got
better things to do anyway, like…
She checks the list.
ALICE
(cont’d)
“Clean all screens with isopropyl
wipes”? For god’s sake… I’m not
doing that.
GWEN
What about the minister?
ALICE
Oh for him I’d use bleach and
wirewool. Maybe some pure chlorine
to finish.
GWEN
What? No that’s not what I(catching herself)
No, we’re not doing this now. Nice
try. Go do the list.
ALICE
Dammit.

5. INT. OIAR BREAKROOM – NIGHT, CLEAR (CCTV)
CELIA is sat sorting through a pile of papers at one of the tables.
SAM enters.
SAM
Ms. Ripley, I do hope you’ve not
been using the department printer
for personal projects?
CELIA
Wouldn’t dream of it.
SAM
You should. This place is a
goldmine. I take a carton of milk and
a roll of toilet paper home every
night.
CELIA gives a slight chuckle but is clearly distracted.
SAM CONT.
Are these the ones Helen sent over?
CELIA
Yeah, I really didn’t think there’d be
so many. The institute must have
been absolutely loaded.
SAM
Surely, they didn’t actually buy all
these?
CELIA
Thankfully no. Anything they actually
got the deed to goes here. These are
the ones where they put in an offer,
but didn’t close the deal, and this
pile is enquiries that didn’t go
anywhere.

[18]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Why not?
CELIA
It varies. Sometimes the owners
didn’t actually want to sell in the end,
sometimes the Magnus guy would
just send a bunch of weird request
then not follow up once they were
answered.
SAM
Weird how?
CELIA
See for yourself.
Sam reads picks up some notes at random and reads.
SAM
Why would they want “a picture of
the constellations as seen from the
Front Elevation facing due east,”
CELIA
I mean, astrology is big in alchemy,
but you’d think the answer would be
obvious based on its location.
Doesn’t make any sense. Or how
about this one?
SAM
(reading)
“Preference for properties with intact
1st generation
(sounding it out)
per-perchloro-“
CELIA
Perchloroethylene machines. I
looked it up. Basically super toxic
washing machines.
[19]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Okay… Were they making a lot of
these “queries”?
CELIA
I think so? I get the impression most
of them were done by phone. The
only ones here were either sent by
letter or done through Helen.
SAM
Hmm. So how can I help?
CELIA
Well, I reckon we start with the sites
they actually owned. I mean, I think
they might technically still own some
of them – I haven’t been able to get
my head round some of the legals.
SAM
Let’s see if I have any luck.
Sam takes some papers and they start to read silently. There is a
gentle tension between them.
SAM
So.
CELIA
So?
SAM
Do we talk about it or…?
CELIA
We can if you want to.
SAM
Cool.
Beat.
[20]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
So what was that?
CELIA
That was sex, Sam. Pretty decent
sex, actually.
SAM
I, uh- Yeah, no, I agree, but…um. Oh,
you know what I mean.
CELIA
Well that depends. What do you want
it to have been? Was it bit of fun, or
two scared people trying to comfort
one another? That’s fine.
You want it to have been something
more? Well, I’d be ok with that too.
SAM
Even with everything else that’s
going on? We might be in genuine
danger. We might die.
CELIA
I mean that’s true of every
relationship really. It’s just a bit
more… obvious with us.
SAM
What do you want?
CELIA
I mean, Jack’s always going to be my
first priority, but beyond that… I
think I’d like it to happen again, if
you’d be ok with it. See where it
goes…
Beat.
[21]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Yeah. Ok. I think I’d like that too.
CELIA
Great.
SAM
(smiling)
Great.
They kiss quickly.
SAM
I can’t stop thinking aboutCELIA
(quickly)
This one is Oxford? Yeah, me
neither.
SAM
Oh err… yeah.
CELIA
It was one of their last purchases, in
1997 I think.
SAM
What do we think they mean by
“retail unit”?
CELIA
Well, the Hilltop Centre’s a small
shopping development just off
Cowley Road. It was built in the 80s,
but it looks like the storefronts didn’t
exactly get snapped up.
SAM
Huh, I’d have thought you’d need to
rent a shopping unit. I didn’t realise
you could buy one outright.
[22]

©Rusty Quill 2023

CELIA
Yeah it’s super weird. So is the fact
that they never really did anything
with it. Apparently, it was set up as
an “outreach centre”, whatever that
means, but it was only occupied for
a month or two. Then they just
locked it up and left it.
SAM
I mean, they only had a couple of
years before- Hang on, is this one of
the ones that they still technically
own?
CELIA
Yup. And the Hilltop Centre’s been
effectively shuttered for a while.
SAM
Meaning that no-one’s been inside…
CELIA
Since 1997. What do you think?
Worth a look?
Alice enters and goes to make herself a coffee as bitter as she is
feeling right now.
ALICE
I swear, if I hear one more word
about Trevor-bloody-Herbert MP I am
going to blow up parliament.
SAM
How’s your list coming?
ALICE
Don’t test me, Sam. I have so many
barrels of gunpowder and the
blessing of the Pope.
[23]

©Rusty Quill 2023

SAM
Is it really that bad?
ALICE
Lena’s going mental over dust
bunnies, Gwen is so far up Lena’s
ass she can see daylight and oh let’s
not forget we’re all being stalked by
a terrifying monster.
CELIA
It is a lot.
ALICE
It’s fine. I’m fine. Just a feeling a bit
more… anti-establishment than
normal. Anyway, what are you two
doing? More Magnussing?
CELIA
Yeah. We’re thinking about having a
bit of a field trip.
SAM
Don’t worry we’ll keep it to
ourselvesALICE
Nah, screw that.
SAM
What?
ALICE
Were you not listening when I told
you about this thing? I’m pretty sure
we let it out when we went poking
around that “Archivist” room at the
ruins. I wanted to stop you before
you did something stupid. But now
we know you already did. So, maybe
[24]

©Rusty Quill 2023

we can dig up something to protect
ourselves.
SAM
Or even stop it for good.
ALICE
I dunno about that, the way Gwen
talks about these things, sounds like
that might be a quick way to get
killed.
CELIA
(quietly)
You didn’t tell me the room was
labelled “Archivist”.
ALICE
(offhandedly)
Sure we did.
CELIA
No. You said you messed up some
sort of ritual design in one of the
locked rooms and thought that might
have released it. You never said the
word “Archivist”.
SAM
Does that matter?
CELIA
I don’t know. Maybe.
ALICE
So which of these are you planning
to start with then?
SAM
The Hilltop Centre. In Oxford.
Celia has a feeling about it.
[25]

©Rusty Quill 2023

ALICE
Oh does she? And would this be a
Good feeling or a bad feeling?
CELIA
I guess we go and find out.
