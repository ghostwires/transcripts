1. INT. OIAR MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (LANDLINE) LENA is typing at her desk. There is a firm but polite knock at the door. 

#### LENA

Come in. GWEN enters. 

#### LENA CONT.

Good evening Gwen. Take a seat. GWEN does so. 

#### LENA CONT.

You wanted to see me? GWEN takes a deep breath. 

#### GWEN

I'm ready. 

#### LENA

Excuse me? 

#### GWEN

I'm ready for my next assignment. Beat. 

#### LENA

I believe I was quite clear when I explained that you no longer hold the Externals Liaison position. 

#### GWEN

You were. 

#### LENA

Yet here you are, once again making demands. Beat. GWEN swallows her pride. 

#### GWEN

I understand now that I may have... mishandled myself previously and... I may have more to learn than I thought. 

#### LENA

Go on. 

#### GWEN

But I've had some time to reflect and... I can do this. I know I can. 

#### LENA

That doesn't change the fact that I cannot in good conscience give you your former role given everything that has happened. It would be... irresponsible. 

#### GWEN

I'm not asking you to give it me. I'm asking for the chance to work for it. To earn it. 

#### LENA

I see. Then I will require you to be honest. You have been deeply troubled by your interactions with our Externals thus far. What has changed? Beat. 

#### GWEN

I... have had some time to consider the situation, and I've decided I'd rather be on the inside. 

#### LENA

You believe working in this role would be less dangerous than simply quitting? That it could afford you some protection? 

#### GWEN

Am I wrong? Pause. 

#### LENA

There is an upcoming visit from the new Minister. Regrettably, he believes himself to be a "hands-on" leader. You will assist me in... humoring him and expediting his departure. If you are able to do this without further complications, we can discuss your future position here. Do I make myself clear? 

#### GWEN

Crystal. 

#### LENA

Good. Then get back to work. And close the door properly on your way out. Beat. Gwen restrains her instincts. She stands and heads to the exit, opens the door then hesitates. 

#### GWEN

(dangerously calm) Thank you Lena. She closes the door. Beat. 

#### LENA

(wary) Hmmm. 

#### 2. CYBERSPACE -- N/A -- N/A



#### NORRIS

NapSafe nannycam Registration 977470 User: Patricia Spaulding Recording: 29.02.2024 Soft sound of a rocking chair as mother rocks her baby in her arms. 

#### MOTHER

There we go. Recording. The health visitor said it wasn't a good idea, but I want to remember everything that happens with Rupert. Especially given how little I remember of the birth. Or the pregnancy. The health visitor says that's normal. I'm already completely smitten with him. He's perfect. His perfectly little round head. His chubby cheeks. His little plum-shaped chin. And his eyes. I read the eye color doesn't really settle until they're older, but the way he looks at me with these big black orbs staring right back at me . . . it makes my heart just burst with joy every time. He hasn't been giving me much sleep of course, the little bugger. But that's to be expected. The health visitor said it was going to be like that for a while. According to her, he needs to eat every four hours, so I need to try and sleep when he's sleeping. Hasn't been easy though. I need to do a better job of keeping time, but I'm pretty sure he's eating more often than that. A mum needs to be there for her little one. No matter what hour of the day it is. No matter what it takes. I'm there for Rupey twenty-four-seven, even if I'm not getting much sleep during those twenty-four. Little Rupert did this darling thing earlier where he stuck out his cute little tongue at me. It was long and thin and curl and just adorable. Made my heart burst with love all over again for this wonderful little thing. 

#### NORRIS

First recording ends. Second Recording. 

#### MOTHER

I think there's something wrong. I don't know what it is. It's possible it's me, or it might be something else. I feel weird saying it out loud. I've started hearing things. Strange sounds. There's only me and Rupert here in the house. I'm sure of that. The sounds haven't been the same either. Sometimes they're moans, sometimes they're barks, like a dog that's far away... definitely not sounds another person would make. I've only heard them on those rare times when Rupert will stay by himself a little bit, dozing. I feel like I'm going crazy. Oh, I shouldn't say that word! That's one of the lessons from the mum's support group. You never use that word to describe yourself. The instructor had a long chat about postpartum depression, and what to watch for. But it's not that. It -- I just need some sleep. Rupert keeps feeding like he doesn't know where he's going to get his next meal from. I've been trying to follow their advice- The support group- There's this lovely girl there, Celia. Really helpful. And Rupert just loves her -- always wants her to hold him. He's so good at the group. Always puts on his best face on. Never cries or snaps at them with those sharp little teeth. I feel a bit self-conscious, though, when I see one of the other mums staring at my bandage. They don't seem to need one. Still, the health visitor says every baby is different. I tried using a dummy but he just let it fall out of his mouth. He looked at me with such hunger in his eyes. I tried formula after that. But he still wasn't having it. He's right, I suppose. He's so clever. Beat. I'm going to admit something now. Just to you. Rupert's in the other room, sleeping for the moment. (takes a deep breath) Sometimes I think there might be something wrong with Rupert... Beat. 

#### MOTHER

(quickly) No.. No, that's just stupid. Now that I've said it out loud, it's just silly. I think it says more about me than him. Probably because I haven't been getting enough sleep. Maybe I do have postnatal problems? I'm going to have to remember to mention it at our next support meeting. 

#### NORRIS

Second recording ends. 

#### NORRIS

Third recording. 

#### MOTHER

Things are . . . dark right now. Bleak. I know it's been a while since I did a recording... I haven't been feeling that well lately. Still making sure to take care of the little one and feed him when he's hungry, which feels like all the bloody time these days. But . . . but things just feel so heavy right now. And slow. Moving around is painful, and I always need more bandages. Thank god for the health visitor. It's all about Rupert though. He's the one who needs everything perfect. So he can keep growing and become a perfect little boy. I don't matter as much. I'll start taking care of myself again when I need to . . . eventually. I've skipped the last two support group meetings. Just haven't felt up to going. It's such a chore, packing up all the things Rupert might need. Nappies and wipes and baby powder and creams and extra clothes and burp cloths and... (getting a little angry) It's all so bloody much! Much better just to stay here. Me and my little Rupert. All we need is each other and that's it... Beat. The lack of sleep is really getting to me though. I do get some at least, but I'd like more. Rupert just keeps needing to eat. And feed. And feed. And eat. At this rate I wonder how much of me will be left... (she shudders) Beat. (all happy and positive again) I love it when he looks at me when he's feeding and then he gives me this big smile. This morning he got a smear of blood on his cheek. Like he was wearing makeup. Just made him look more beautiful... Makes it all worth it. And he's made me feel all better. Just looking at your cute little face, Rupey, brings light to my dark world. 

#### NORRIS

Third recording ends. Fourth recording. 

#### MOTHER

I . . . I really need some sleep. I feel so . . . drained. Rupert... Rupert keeps getting his feedings, Not going to change that. Can't change that. Has to eat. I have to eat too. So he can eat. 

#### I...

(takes a shaky breath) I had a... a strange thing happen today. Very... Very strange... Rupey was in his crib. In the... the room. The room where he sleeps. Sometimes. And... and when I came in... (another breath) On the wall was this... the shadow was wrong... I couldn't scream, though. Couldn't... couldn't wake him up. I turned on the light. To make it go away. And when the light came on, it was gone. And there... there was Rupey. Sitting up in his crib. Looking... looking at me... Watching me... The health visitor says its normal. They're here every day now. Such a help. Sound of something mewling to be fed. It is not a baby. You hungry again? Rupey? Come on. Come here then. The arm this time? Ok... 

#### NORRIS

Fourth recording ends. Fifth Recording. 

#### MOTHER

(exhausted, ragged quiet voice, almost a whisper) I don't know what's happening... to me... It all feels dark... like it's black clouds... all the time. I can't remember when... when I last... had sleep. I think... I think days... It all feels too heavy... to move. So I'm sitting... I'm sitting all the time. But... But I've got Rupert. On my lap. So he can eat. When he wants. He can have...me. My all. He's... he's what's...imp-...imp-...imp-or-tant. I don't...I don't know what's...going...to...happen. There's not much of me left. (breathing heavier) I'm so scared. But...at least...Rupey's happy... Recording ends. 

#### 3. INT. OIAR MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR

(COMPUTER) SAM and CELIA are packing up to go. 

#### CELIA

All set? 

#### SAM

Just about. 

#### CELIA

You all right? You sound nervous. 

#### SAM

I mean, maybe a little, but it's good nervous. I think. 

#### CELIA

Good. Let's go and shake some answers out of people. 

#### SAM

You are way too excited for this. They start to head out but ALICE approaches and they hesitate. 

#### ALICE

Heading off? 

#### CELIA

We are, yeah. 

#### SAM

And before you ask, yes, we've cleared our cases for the night. 

#### ALICE

Cool. Listen SamSAM -and no we haven't asked Lena if we can leave early. It's not like you ever doALICE (sharply) Would you shut up and listen. Beat. 

#### ALICE CONT.

(serious) Look, I need to talk to you both. 

#### CELIA

(meeting her tone) What's wrong? 

#### ALICE

I don't- I don't think you should go. 

#### SAM

Really? This again? 

#### CELIA

(ignoring Sam) Go on. 

#### ALICE

It's Gwen. She's- not okay. 

#### SAM

We noticed. Not really much we can do about it, though. (curious despite himself) And since when do you care? 

#### ALICE

Since it became clear that something really bad is going on. 

#### CELIA

What happened? 

#### ALICE

(struggling) It's the, uh, 'Externals'... 

#### SAM

Those contractors she's been working with? 

#### ALICE

No. Well yeah, but it's more than that. They... They're not... Human. It's bad. Bad bad. People have been killed and... and I think one of them might be... targeting us. 

#### SAM

(incredulous) What. 

#### ALICE

I'm serious all right! You remember that woman I found? 

#### SAM

Yeah. 

#### ALICE

Well, I think it might have been one of these "Externals". There was the tape recorder, and Gwen said she sawSAM Tape recorder? What are-? Look, Alice, I know you don't like me looking into this stuff, but killer tape recorders is weird even for you. 

#### CELIA

(to Alice) I believe you. 

#### SAM

What? 

#### ALICE

Really? 

#### CELIA

Yeah. I mean, you know, after everything we've been seeing coming through the system? It makes sense. 

#### SAM

It does? 

#### CELIA

(To Sam) Is it really so hard to believe that something is hunting us back? Beat. 

#### SAM

(reluctant) I suppose it's not impossible. Okay, so let's say, just for the sake of argument, that we believe you. What are we supposed to do about it? Hmm? I don't know if you noticed but we're not exactly equipped to fight off monsters or evil VHS tapes or whatever. 

#### ALICE

You could stop poking your nose in where it doesn't belong for a start! 

#### SAM

So it is about that. I knew it. Look, if you are right about this, and I'm not saying you are, surely that only makes it more important to figure out what's going on? 

#### ALICE

Are you serious right now? None of this started until you joined and started kicking beehives! 

#### CELIA

Or perhaps you just didn't see it. I'm with Sam on this one. I don't think ignorance is going to keep us safe. 

#### SAM

And the Magnus Institute is involved. I just know it. 

#### ALICE

I'm just trying toCELIA But that doesn't mean we can't be careful, take precautions, watch each other's backs. Right? Beat. 

#### CELIA CONT.

Right? 

#### SAM

...Right. 

#### ALICE

I guess that'll have to do. Pause. 

#### SAM

Cool. Then I guess we've got a tube to catch. SAM starts walking off. 

#### ALICE

(quietly to Celia) Keep an eye on him. 

#### CELIA

I will. 

#### SAM

(Calling) Celia come on, we're going to be late! CELIA jogs off to join Sam. They exit. Alice stands there concerned. 

#### ALICE

(softly) Shit. 4. INT -- SCHOOL OFFICE -- MORNING, CLEAR (Sam's Mobile) 

#### CELIA

(quietly) -Your phone recording? 

#### SAM

(quietly) All good. SAM and CELIA are led into the deputy headmistress's office. 

#### BASIRA

Good morning Mr. and Mrs... Fisher is it? Good. Please take a seat. SAM and CELIA sit. BASIRA leafs through various papers. 

#### BASIRA

(tired) So I understand you're hoping to enrole your son, is that correct? 

#### SAM

Er... yes, that's right. We've heard very good things about St. Luke's. 

#### BASIRA

Well that's what we like to hear. I assume you've completed an application already? Good. Well once we've got that, you'll be asked to come for a tour with... 

#### CELIA

Humphry. SAM snorts. 

#### BASIRA

...Humphry and you'll have a chance to meet some of our staff. 

#### SAM

We'd also like to know a little more about you if that's all right? 

#### BASIRA

(Thrown) Me? 

#### CELIA

We know St. Luke's is prestigious but I think we both know that what really makes an exceptional school is the person calling the shots right? 

#### BASIRA

(Slightly mollified) Well you're not wrong, though I'll remind you I am only deputy head. Mr. Donaldson technically runs the school, though he is not on site today. 

#### SAM

So, what's your history? 

#### BASIRA

Excuse me? 

#### CELIA

You'll have to excuse my husband's bluntness. He works in finance. 

#### BASIRA

Ah. 

#### CELIA

What he is trying to ask is if we could please know a little more about your background before coming to St. Luke's? 

#### BASIRA

I see. Well, I've been in charge here for almost five years. This is my fourth educational position and second deputy head role. I was also nominated for a Pearson Award for my previous work at Edgecroft Academy. 

#### CELIA

That's very impressive. 

#### SAM

And before that you were a teacher? Any work or experience at other academic institutions? 

#### BASIRA

(bristling) I do have actual classroom experience, if that's what you're implying. 

#### CELIA

I think my husband is wondering what it was that led you to working in the school system? Beat. 

#### BASIRA

(terse) I was raised with a respect for education by a pair of academics. I am told that children like me and I've always held the opinion that the world would be a better place if everyone just thought more. Is that sufficient for your husband? 

#### SAM

Er... yes. Thank you. 

#### BASIRA

Are you sure? I may be able to rustle up my old school reports, a vaccination record perhaps? CELIA laughs awkwardly to ease the tension. 

#### SAM

Have you ever been involved with the Magnus Institute? 

#### BASIRA

(caught off guard) What? No. I don't- Is that a school? 

#### SAM

Sort of. Maybe. 

#### BASIRA

(impatient) Well, I've never even heard of it. What is this about? 

#### CELIA

How about the police? 

#### BASIRA

(angry now) I'm sorry, what has that got to do with anything? 

#### SAM

(thrown) Good question. 

#### CELIA

I'm just wondering, holding so many positions of responsibility, did you ever consider becoming a police officer? 

#### BASIRA

I did not. (standing) Look, 'Mr. and Mrs. Fisher', I suspect you may have me confused with someone else. Regardless, our time is up and I have other places I need to be. 

#### SAM

No, yeah of course. Sorry. 

#### CELIA

Thank you so much for meeting with us. 

#### BASIRA

(ushering them out) Mrs. Banks will show to the main entrance. Any further enquiries about enrollment should be directed to our admissions department. 

#### CELIA

Of course. 

#### BASIRA

Good day to both of you. The door is closed brusquely. Beat. 

#### SAM

Well, that could have gone better. What was that police stuff about? 

#### CELIA

Thought I remembered something from the file. Guess I was wrong. Anyway, come on. Humphry's waiting for us. 

#### SAM

Who? Oh right, yeah. 'Humphry'.
