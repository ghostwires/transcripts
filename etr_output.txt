##### [Music]

1. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER) ALICE is sat at her desk with Celia beside her. SAM returns from the breakroom with a hot drink. 

#### SAM

(approaching) There was a peppermint teabag in the back of the cupboard. Thought it might be better than coffee considering... well. He puts it on the desk next to Alice 

#### ALICE

(quietly) Thanks. Beat. 

#### CELIA

Do you want to talk about it? 

#### ALICE

I... Christ I still shake when I think about it. 

#### SAM

It's okay. 

#### CELIA

C'mere. CELIA holds ALICE. Comforting stillness. 

#### ALICE

(sniffing) Thanks. Yeah I'm... I'm all right. Just a lot y'know? I haven't seen someone die since... 

#### SAM

Yeah. 

#### ALICE

I went back afterwards. Couldn't just leave her. Tape player was gone and she'd stopped speaking, and when the paramedics turned up and they just called it straight away. Said she'd been dead for ages. Beat. 

#### CELIA

But... 

#### ALICE

But I heard her talking... about drowning. Paramedics just wanted to treat me for shock. They kept telling me there was no way she could have been walking with that much water in her lungs. Beat. 

#### SAM

What are you saying? 

#### ALICE

I don't know. Maybe that I'm finally losing it? Beat. 

#### CELIA

I believe you. 

#### ALICE

No you don't. 

#### CELIA

I'm serious. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I know exactly what happened, but I don't think you just saw a body and freaked out. That's not the Alice I know. 

#### SAM

Same. And it's not like it's any weirder than half the stuff we read here. Beat. 

#### ALICE

(touched) Thanks guys. Maybe... Eurgh. (sighing) I know it's selfish but, I kind of hoped I'd paid my horror dues working here, y'know? 

#### CELIA

I think there's plenty of it to go around at the moment. Beat. 

#### ALICE

Whelp cheers for the pep talk and all but we should probably get on. The last thing I need is Lena getting on my case on top of everything else. 

#### SAM

You're sure you're ok to work? 

#### ALICE

Yeah. I already wasted most of Sunday crying about it. Anyway, odds are Freddie will spit out a transcript of the whole thing. Least I can do is make sure it's filed properly, right? 

#### SAM

So would that be Z for zombie or...? Beat. 

#### SAM

I'm just going to... um... yeah... SAM double clicks and the case begins. 2. CYBERSPACE -- N/A, N/A (COMPUTER)

MadamElectrum.wordpress.com Videos: Madam E/Ink5oul -- Tattoo Reveal! 

#### 30-10-2023



#### MADAM E

Hey guys! It's the one you've been waiting for, I know. I've had so many messages: when's it happening, when's it gonna be? Well, here we are! Madam Electrum coming to you live with the tattoo terror themselves, the one, the only, Ink5oul! 

#### INK5OUL

(aloof) Hey. 

#### MADAM E

So for any of you sweetums who have been sleeping on this, Ink5oul is the tattoo CEO Period. No cap, their designs are in-credible and only for the true ubergoth. Ain't that right? 

#### INK5OUL

That's what they tell me. 

#### MADAM E

And let me say, they are the absolute GOAT so I'm here for my very own, completely personalized, absolutely aesthetic, totally vegan, boujee ink, for free! 

#### INK5OUL

That's right. 

#### MADAM

This is seriously... I'm going in straight blind and trusting the process, I am that full on Ink5oul stan. So, as I finna get marked, make sure you're following on socials, subbed to my Youtube and OnlyFans (if you know, you know) and sending those like, like, likes! 

#### INK5OUL

You ready for your heart's desire? 

#### MADAM E

(laughing, nervous) I'm literally shaking! But... What's the worst that can happen? 

#### INK5OUL

Let's find out. 

##### [DUN DUN DUN]

INK5OUL starts to tattoo and MADAM E gasps in extreme pain. 

#### CUT TO:

INK5oul drops the used needle into a metal container with MADAM E still gasping for breath. 

#### MADAM E

(hurting) Is... is it over? 

#### INK5OUL

Take a look. MADAM E sits up wincing and looks at herself in the mirror. 

#### INK5OUL CONT.

What do you think? 

#### MADAM E

Oh... Oh wow... 

#### INK5OUL

Now get out. Beat.

Videos: Recent Ink5oul rumours! 

#### 19-12-2023



#### MADAM E

Hey guys! So, you've all been asking, and yeah, ya fave thick and perky kindergoth is finally finna spill on the whole Ink5oul drama. Now y'all know I'm not one to sip when there's tea, even when they're mutuals but this is super hard for me cos, like, y'all know I'm kinda in a situationship with them ever since I got that heart tat and I don't wanna throw shade. But I gotta be savage, cos I got something been living rent free and... I gotta talk about it, ya get me? So like, since getting that ink I been feeling AMAZING and I admit I mighta got a bit extra, simping on Ink5oul. So you knows ya girl was slidin' into their DMs- Holla to all them other thirsty girls!- and got into a bit of a Kiki. We was chattin' 'bout their work, how much I love it and that, and ya girl got to asking where they got their ideas cos like, obviously I'm no cap jelly of their skills. So they was all like "secrets" and, sure, but that got me sus cos like, we was high key vibing then suddenly they're just dead y'know? Anyway, after that we both hustlin' as we do an' don't talk for a while. Then from nowhere they're like "so are you a real goth or not?" And I'm like She makes a scoffing noise. 

#### MADAM E

"I'm more goth than y'all can handle", and they just send me "from.vision.ruled, Thursday, two thirty AM". Takes a tick for me to clock that it's a threewords but when I look it up, turns out it's this patch up in Highgate Cemetery. Natch, I was in. Sure it's a bit sus but also like. that's, Gothdam central, No way I'd pass up the chance to vibe with Ink5oul there, even if it was a bit of an afterparty ya feel me? So I sneaked in, allegedly, and there they were just chillin in the dark with a big-ass spade over their shoulder, big mood amirite? I figure ya girl is in for a spooky treat, bit of roleplay but theyre still straight dead with me, just tell me to follow, so I do. We head on through the graves and then they point to one of 'em and just give me a look. I was no cap shook and then they just said "dig". I laughed, 'cause, like, the 'hell? But they were serious. "I thought you were goth?" they said. Now ya girl is hella goth, but this, this was just nasty so I told them they were outta pocket and they just give me the look again and whisper "don't make me break your heart." And I'm telling you, I could feel the words in my chest y'know? Brutal. That does me and so I am out of there like that. (snaps fingers) Now I ain't no fool and I know crazy when I peep it. So I bail. But that ain't the whole story, oh no. Cos i know some of you seen on the news next day there's this whole thing about someone breaking into Highgate and no-cap robbing graves. Now I know what y'all are thinking and hell no I ain't gonna call it in but, like... Y'all gotta know what's up. And, like, where does Ink5oul get all their ideas huh? Are they really all that or maybe, maybe they're just bitin' stuff from some mouldy old bodies? Nasty. Ya girl is a goth, not a ghoul and I am done with Ink5oul. That's all I got time for right now. I'll be back with another vid next week but till then Darklove to all my creepy sweeties, and laters-haters! Peace!

Videos: Madam E -- OMG That callout video! 

#### 19-12-2023

MADAM E is still in studio but she is deeply upset, crying with cracks in her persona. 

#### MADAM E

Hey guys, M&M here with another update. She sighs, tearful. 

#### MADAM E CONT.

Y'all probably heard by now that Ink5oul dragged me on their channels. It was... it was vicious pick-me trash and everyone bought it and their stans are seriously extra cos... yeah there's been proper hate at me and y'know I try to rise above... but it's hard. I'm a good person. I'm such a good person but... I've been getting callouts, death threats, they even doxxed me and then the cops turned up trying to pin all that grave robbing BS on me! It was total bull, I didn't do jack but Ink5oul did me dirty and so now I guess we're opps. They are a psycho but no one believes me! I've wanted to talk about this stuff for time but I knew if I did they'd turn on me and give y'all totally the wrong idea and now everyone is taking their side and it's not... it's not... She gasps and clasps her chest. 

#### MADAM E CONT.

It hurts. All that hate, all those people wanting me dead or worse... I can feel it. No cap, it hits right here. It's like y'all are bees stinging me over and over right in the heart. I dunno if the camera's picking it up but you can even see it... She positions herself in front of the camera. 

#### MADAM E CONT.

That's not okay. I'm not okay. I just, I just wanted y'all to listen but instead... I'm gonna be taking some time away from socials. Big thanks to all of you who've been stepping up for me, but I can't... I just can't. Beat.

Videos: Madam E -- Help (Unposted) 

#### 03-01-2024

A hospital bed. Madam E is in a terrible state, breathless and struggling to speak through the pain. 

#### MADAM E

Hey everyone. I've been getting a lot of, um, worried comments... on my last vid... so I wanted to update. I've got to... be quiet. Not meant to have my phone. So since that last vid, things got worse... started getting dodgy mail... then someone set my door on fire... The cats are okay but... had to move back in with mum and dad and now... She coughs weakly. It sounds awful. 

#### MADAM E

I'm... in the hospital... there's something wrong with my heart... but they're not sure... She gasps again. 

#### MADAM E

It hurts... It hurts so much... mum says its stress but doctor says its an infection from the tattoo. but... I know it's more than that... She coughs painfully again and begins crying. 

#### MADAM E

I just wanted to be noticed... I just... I don't deserve this... please, please just stop... the views are cutting me... the comments hurt... I'm done... I'm done and... and... She struggles to breathe, an alarm starts beeping. There is the sound of tearing skin and a gurgled sound, as though something were tearing itself free of her flesh. The recoding ends 3. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER) 

#### SAM

Alice? Are you... 

#### ALICE

(sharply) I'm fine. Beat. 

#### ALICE

Dammit! I'm getting a coffee. Alice abruptly stands and stomps over to the break room. 

#### SAM

We should probably... 

#### CELIA

Yeah... They both stand and follow her in. Extended pause. Gwen enters and approaches. 

#### GWEN

For god's sake! The second I'm not around... She leans over starts reading Sam's case. Lena angrily knocks on the glass of her office. 

#### GWEN CONT.

(muttering) Christ, what now? 

#### 4. INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (LANDLINE).

GWEN opens the door unceremoniously to find LENA waiting for her. 

#### GWEN

What now? 

#### LENA

Sit. 

#### GWEN

Look maybe you didn't notice but no one is at their desks and the case load tonight isLENA (Quietly furious) Sit. Down. Beat. Gwen reads the room, heads over to her seat and sits. 

#### LENA CONT.

Are you stupid? 

#### GWEN

(bristling) Excuse me? 

#### LENA

(louder) I said Are. You. Stupid? 

#### GWEN

I don'tLENA Because that's the only possible explanation I can find for why you would think it was appropriate to bring an External into our offices. 

#### GWEN

I just thought it might be safer if they were in a controlled environment. 

#### LENA

Safer? You marched a dangerous asset right through the office without taking any precautions! For goodness sake, you gave her a tour! You introduced her to your colleagues! That poses a completely unacceptable risk to personnel. 

#### GWEN

I was with her almost the whole time. Besides, Lady Mowbray is a lady, an actual, married into the house of lords, Lady. It's not like I was holding doors open for Mr. Bonzo or anything. 

#### LENA

You have no idea how dangerous she is. 

#### GWEN

No, I don't, because you don't tell me anything! 

#### LENA

And I will keep it that way until you have proven to me that you can be trusted to think before you act. 

#### GWEN

Or I die right? Because I can't help noticing that you're happy to send me out alone to meet all these dangerous Externals that you are too afraid to even let into the building! Beat. 

#### LENA

Gwen, if the O.I.A.R. is to function it is imperative that the Externals respect us and the boundaries we impose upon them. OtherwiseGWEN Fine! No Externals on site, understood. Happy? Beat. 

#### LENA

It's becoming clear to me that you are struggling with your new position and so I think it might best if youGWEN Give me another assignment. 

#### LENA

Gwen... 

#### GWEN

You can't take this away just because I did something you never bothered to tell me not to. You're always going on about how difficult it is to find reliable staff. Then why don't you try actually training me for once? 

#### LENA

Would you even listen? 

#### GWEN

There's one way to find out. LENA sighs. 

#### LENA

I will ... consider it. You may go. Gwen furiously stands and leaves. Lena sighs again.
