#### EXT. THE GALLOPING ENGLISHMAN -- DECK -- LATE AFTERNOON -- PAST

[ALESTES' memories The CREW of the GALLOPING ENGLISHMAN cheer as ANH and ALESTES fight] 

#### ALESTES

What's wrong, Annie? Feeling tired already? 

#### ANH

Just thought you could use the break, what with your history of loss. 

#### ALESTES

Is that what you'd call today's quarry? A loss? 

#### ANH

One ransacked ship and she thinks she's queen of the world! 

#### ALESTES

Guns? 

#### ANH

Bare fists. 

#### ALESTES

You're on. 

#### ANH

Can you move any slower, my sweet? 

#### ALESTES

I'll pick up the pace once you learn how to throw a real punch. Lost your sea legs? 

#### ANH

Screw you! 

#### ALESTES

What happened to just fists? 

#### ANH

Are you scared? 

#### ALESTES

Of what? You descaling a fish? On your knees. I said: get down on your knees. Drop the knife. Anh. Relent. Anh. ANH laughs, weakly, on the brink of unconsciousness. 

#### ANH

[laughing] Make. Me. [ALESTES let's go, ANH coughs] 

#### ANH

You should have killed me! 

#### ALESTES

Sometimes I wonder if you remember that we're on the same crew, Anh. 

#### ANH

Awww! You're breaking my heart. Is that what daddy tells you at night? Sweet dreams, little 'Lestes, and remember to be polite to the crew in the morning? 

#### ALESTES

Baker is not my father. 

#### ANH

"Baker"? Huh. Funny. I bet you wish we were all a happy little family, sailing along, singing songs, hand-in-handALESTES What exactly do you have, Anh? Playing second-fiddle for a man that barely remembers your name. 

#### ANH

That's more like it! There's the Alestes with power. 

#### ALESTES

"Power" is what you want, Anh. Leave me out of it. 

#### ANH

Baker, Gammon, the both of them, can't you see they're contorting you, keeping you down? 

#### ALESTES

And you'll treat me better? 

#### ANH

You and me, Alestes. We're the ones that should be in charge. 

#### ALESTES

Power comes with responsibilities. Find someone else to entertain your mutiny. 

#### ANH

How can you be soALESTES Stay here and moan if you want. I'm bored of this. 

#### ANH

Alestes. Alestes! 

#### EXT. NETAOANSOM -- DECK -- DAY

[A quiet port. The sound of ANH's flute] 

#### ALESTES

Get off my ship, Anh. [ANH climbs down the rigging from the bird's nest, landing on the deck ALESTES removes her coat] 

#### ANH

Oh my, taking our clothes off already, darling? Buy a lady a drink first. 

#### ALESTES

I like this coat, and I don't feel like scrubbing your blood from it. 

#### ANH

Straight to the fight without any foreplay[ALESTES unsheathes her sword] 

#### ANH (CONT'D)

Just like the old days. I like it. 

#### INT. GAMMON'S HIDEAWAY -- DAY -- PRESENT

[SIVA is crying. MARY enters and sets a tea tray on the table] 

#### MARY

Let's get some tea in you. 

#### SIVA

Was he telling the truth? 

#### MARY

About which part? 

#### SIVA

That the raid was only successful because of my map. 

#### MARY

...They would have found the place eventually. 

#### SIVA

'Eventually'. 

#### MARY

Though, yes, I don't believe anyone involved could have imagined a document that allowed such one-sided tactical warfare. The poor devils were shot to pieces, and remained none the wiser until the very last second. [SIVA sobs] 

#### MARY (CONT'D)

There, there... Don't cry, Mary's here now. ...Why don't you tell me what's making you so upset? 

#### SIVA

... I killed her. 

#### MARY

Killed... who? 

#### SIVA

My Nani. My grandmother. She told me to be careful, to trust no-one, and then she -- she was hiding this behind my back! If I had known, if she had told me what she was doing -- who she was involved with, I wouldn't have -- I could have warned her -- but she didn't, and so I couldn't and And now she's dead. 

#### MARY

Johana Keijl was your grandmother. 

#### SIVA

She didn't... she hated that name. It wasn't hers. It was what she was sold as. She was just Nani, she preferred that. 

#### MARY

I see. ...And this Nani really is dead, this isn't some subterfuge? [SIVA makes a pained noise] 

#### MARY (CONT'D)

Yes, yes… This one is important, Siva. I need you to really think about what I'm asking. Your grandmother, did she ever say why she might be plotting against the Governor? 

#### SIVA

... She wanted me to remember this island as it could be, not as it is. 

#### MARY

[a humourless laugh] All this trouble because of an actual slave uprising. Graham will not be pleased. 

#### SIVA

An "actual" uprising? 

#### MARY

My brother is a pompous fool. He was worse when he was younger. A prig in every sense of the word. A school bully so polite that you thanked him for choosing you to bash against the wall. A man despised and desired by all, in equal measure. A gentleman in good graces. A Governorship across the sea -- a whole island of people to order around "This is what I was born for, Mary," he would say. The whole journey over. "This is what I was born for." A small island, for sure, but plenty of potential. Cinnamon, tea, plantations of every kind. It could not have been a more simple opportunity. And yet, even then. Even with one job to do. Even then, the crown got tired of him. 

#### SIVA

He really isn't the Governor anymore? 

#### MARY

Kalitivu has been officially deemed too insignificant to require a Governor for some years now. 

#### SIVA

But- I've lived here my whole life. How did we not... 

#### MARY

No use telling the locals and getting them uppity. I told him that now would be the perfect opportunity to use whatever we had left, invest it in a venture, secure our futures. But he couldn't do one thing right with his life. In a few weeks, Captain Gammon will be caught, killed, and the occupied island of Kalitivu will be remanded back to the British soldiers because of the excellent work of former-Governor Graham Peters. "What better way to prove my worth than to catch a terrifying Pirate leading slave rebellions, Mary!" 

#### SIVA

But... he's Captain Gammon. 

#### MARY

Yes? It's far easier to mop up troubles of your own creation. Why actually help when one can create a problem and then make it go away? 

#### SIVA

So he's doing all this becauseMARY A promotion to Governor of Ceylon, perhaps, but ultimately, he wants to go back to his damp little boys' clubs with his honour redeemed. 

#### SIVA

That's... 

#### MARY

A monumental waste of time and money? And it almost came crumbling down around his feet because your silly little grandmother tried using a brain she wasn't born to use. SIVA makes a shocked sound. 

#### MARY (CONT'D)

Oh. Apologies. It is not in my nature to put on a maternal front. I'll be honest Siva, I don't particularly enjoy being my brother's little go-between, but you rats really do need to stop being so... scheming. It makes it so hard for one to get anything done around here. 

#### SIVA

I- I'll tell them. 

#### MARY

Who: the soldiers out there, eating food better than they get served in England? Or the rest of the defeated little revolutionaries crawling around the island? Or, better yet, the pirate captain you spurned outside? 

#### SIVA

My friends, they'll -- they'll come for me. 

#### MARY

Then they'd better get here quickly. The second you're not useful, Siva, it won't just be your fingers Anh will remove. 

#### EXT. GAMMON'S HIDEAWAY -- DAY

[INEZ, BAKER and NOOR are making their careful way through the corridors] 

#### INEZ

Once we've found Siva, we'll need some way to get off the island. 

#### NOOR

Alestes would not have really left, would she? 

#### INEZ

Let's not bet on the "Captain" having found a beating human heart in the last hour. 

#### NOOR

... She has her moments, but she comes around in the end. 

#### INEZ

Oh really? ... If she's still there, ask her what she pawned to afford those "magic" turtles. 

#### NOOR

What are you talking about? 

#### INEZ

She's always complaining that we're not making enough, but somehow she can afford to buy the secret to a treasure hoard? She's desperate, and she's heartless. 

#### NOOR

...She sold my bracelets? 

#### INEZ

Why don't you ask him? 

#### NOOR

Baker? 

#### BAKER

... I... wouldn't put it past her. 

#### NOOR

Oh, I… I see. [A GUARD rounds the corner] 

#### GUARD

Hey! You there, stop[INEZ has stabbed him] 

#### INEZ

Shh, shh, shhh... 

#### NOOR

Inez youBAKER Killed him. 

#### INEZ

Because you two are blabbering too loudly. What, you want us to tie him up? Ask him nicely not to shout for help? 

#### BAKER

But to take another person's life... Inez... 

#### INEZ

What is it with you two? With all of you? We are on a rescue mission. It's us, or it's them. Kill or be killed. That's the world we live in. 

#### BAKER

"Other people are all we have. We look after our neighbours, and they look after us." 

#### INEZ

[Laughs] Would you rather he'd taken your life? ...No, I didn't think so. Now let's go, before his friends find him. 

#### EXT. NETAOANSOM -- DECK

[ALESTES and ANH fight] 

#### ANH

I thought you'd try to run without saying goodbye, but I didn't bet on you being alone. What's the matter, 'Lesty, you abandon your new crew already? Oh no, did they abandon you? That is tragic! 

#### ALESTES

Do you have to speak SoMuchOr can we kill each other in silence? 

#### ANH

You know what's been bugging me? In all our years together, I would never have described you as a quitter. Plenty of things I hated about you, but to quit? Not you. Not my Alestes. Not until the day you ran. 

#### ALESTES

So that's a no on the fighting in silence, then. 

#### ANH

We work well together, 'Lestes. Equals in a sea of filth. And if you wanted out from under the pig's thumb, you know I would have killed him for you. In a moment! [A pause in the fight] 

#### ANH (CONT'D)

We could have taken everything, that night. You could have had a pretty life for yourself. You don't want power? No responsibility? Fine, all fine! I'd have even taken in your old man, if it meant keeping you by my side. But you left. You just left. Why did you do that? 

#### ALESTES

I have my reasons, Anh. 

#### ANH

Tell me. 

#### ALESTES

You won't like my answer. 

#### ANH

I'd rather not like you than be confused by you, Alestes. 

#### ALESTES

... I was trying to protect you. 

#### ANH

Protect me? From what? You? 

#### ALESTES

... From him. 

#### ANH

Gammon?? What makes you think I need protecting from him? I'm not a fool, Alestes. You've always been plotting something, I know it. You can tell me. You can trust me. I am the only person in the world who sees who you really are. Who you could be. 

#### ALESTES

... He won't make you his heir. Even now. Even this close to getting what he wants, to going back to England, honour restored. He'd rather blow the whole fleet up than hand it over to you. You're going to shoulder the blame, Annie. He's going to sell you out like you're nothing. A human sacrifice. 

#### ANH

You say that like it isn't part of my planALESTES If you know his plans, why are you still here, doing his dirty work? 

#### ANH

Tell me where I'll get a better view of his demise than by his right hand side? 

#### ALESTES

You're deluding yourself, Anh. You always have been. How many chances have you had to kill the man? But here you still are. Still vying for his affections, like it's some competition between us. You'll go down for him one last time, and you'll have no-one to blame but yourself. [ANH launches a new bout of attacks on ALESTES] 

#### INT. GAMMON'S HIDEAWAY -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

[INEZ, BAKER and NOOR creeping through the corridors] 

#### TRIO

Siva? Siiivvaa? 

#### SIVA

In here!! 

#### BAKER

There, that door- 

#### NOOR

Siva!! [NOOR tries to break down the door] 

#### INEZ

Shh! Do you want the whole island to hear? Move out of the way. [INEZ begins picking the lock] 

#### BAKER

Explosives, assassinations and now lock picking? Who are you? 

#### INEZ

Quiet, I need to hear. [The lock unlatches] 

#### SIVA

You came for me. 

#### NOOR

Of course we came. 

#### BAKER

Are you injured? Did they hurt you? 

#### SIVA

- I didn't know if -- I couldn't remember where the exit was and -- I was just running around the garden and INEZ You escaped? 

#### SIVA

They caught me and- Alestes was there and -- she said all these horrible things and then Mary said Anh was going to kill me! [SIVA nearly falls] 

#### BAKER

Woah, steady. Lost your land legs already? 

#### INEZ

We don't have time for your fainting fits, Siva. 

#### NOOR

Here, if you can't stand, let me carry you. 

#### INEZ

Let him walk. 

#### NOOR

You take the bag, Siva, and then get on my back[SIVA hefts the bag, NOOR lifts him up] 

#### SIVA

Thank you. 

#### BAKER

You're safe, Siva. 

#### NOOR

We've got you. 

#### SIVA

I killed her, Noor. It was me. I killed my Nani. 

#### NOOR

No, you didn't. 

#### BAKER

Whatever they told you, lad, they were lying. 

#### SIVA

I did. If it wasn't for meINEZ Now we've found him, let's burn this place down and run. 

#### BAKER

Burn itWhat is that? 

#### INEZ

Alestes' magic turtles. Filled with gunpowder and a fuse. One here, the other by the storage room out back. I bet you that's where they've packed their ammo. Boom, the whole place will go up in flames. 

#### BAKER

No, Inez. Absolutely not! 

#### INEZ

Keep it down. Do you want to draw their attention? 

#### BAKER

We are not blowing the place up. There are people in this building who work here. People like Siva's grandmother, who will get caught up in whatever revenge fantasy you're acting out. 

#### INEZ

How else do you expect them to learn their lesson? To making themNOOR Siva- stop wriggling, or I'll drop youGUARDS Over there!! 

#### INEZ

Come on, let's goBAKER Not until you give me that bomb, Inez! 

#### INEZ

'kaloka --! [you piss me off] Baker, you want this to end? To stop the bad people from coming after Siva? This is how we do that. [SIVA jumps off NOOR's back] 

#### SIVA

Inez? 

#### INEZ

Yes? [SIVA shoves INEZ] 

#### INEZ

Ow! What the[SIVA yanks the bomb off of INEZ -- then runs] 

#### INEZ (CONT'D)

Hey!! Bring that back!! Where are you going, Siva! 

#### BAKER

Run, lad! Get that bomb back to the ship! 

#### GUARDS

You there, STOP!! 

#### INEZ

Noor, the bag- get me a weapon NOOR Siva has it. The guards file in, surround them. 

#### GUARDS

Hands in the air!! 

#### INEZ

Shit. 

#### EXT. NETAOANSOM -- DECK

[ALESTES and ANH are both exhausted from this fight. ALESTES judo-throws ANH] 

#### ANH

Oh Alestes, straddling me in broad daylight? Someone might see. 

#### ALESTES

He told me to kill you. 

#### ANH

... What? 

#### ALESTES

He told me to kill you. But I didn't want to do that, and so here we are. 

#### ANH

...You should have tried. 

#### ALESTES

I'm not going to kill you, Anh. Not then, not now, not ever. 

#### ANH

If you don't, I'll chase you down for as long as I live, and make your life hell. 

#### ALESTES

Do you not have anything better to do with your time? 

#### ANH

Nothing delights me as much as that look on your face, when you're seconds away from losing control. 

#### ALESTES

AnhANH Yeah. There it is. [A distant explosion -- and then the startled flight of birds. Both stop.] 

#### ALESTES

That came fromANH The house. 

#### ALESTES

...Was that your plan?! Distract me down here while your cronies blew him upANH And miss the chance to kill him myself? [ANH uses the distraction to wrestle her way on top. She pulls out her knife] 

#### ANH (CONT'D)

I prefer when you're on top, but... I suppose I could get used to watching you lie there, powerless... 

#### ALESTES

I have to go. 

#### ANH

Why, so you can protect the people that abandoned you? 

#### ALESTES

Anh. 

#### ANH

You'll hurt a girl's feelings, thinking about other people at a time like this. 

#### ALESTES

I have to go. 

#### EXT. GAMMON'S HIDEAWAY -- FORECOURT -- EARLY EVENING

[Part of the house behind them is burning.] 

#### MARY

Bloody ingrates -- the lot of them- 

#### GAMMON

Don't gripe, Mary. It's not lady-like. 

#### MARY

Our estate is burning down, Graham, the least you could do isGAMMON Oh don't be dramatic, they barely damaged the West Wing. 

#### MARY

The wing we reside inGAMMON I am dealing with the issue, MaryMARY "Dealing with it?" You have the culprits, have a guard kill them! 

#### GAMMON

You think whoever else is out there will take kindly to us killing our only hostages? 

#### INEZ

You two just love the sound of your own voices, don't you. [GAMMON knocks INEZ out. She falls unconscious] 

#### NOOR & BAKER

Inez! 

#### GAMMON

Why does nobody understand that I'm not just playing around, here? Guard, truss that one before they wake up. You two get on your knees or I'll knock you both down next. 

#### BAKER

Go ahead. 

#### GAMMON

Don't test me Baker, or I'll shoot the one in the headscarf and you can watch their blood water my damned roses. 

#### NOOR

...Let us do as he says, Baker. 

#### GAMMON

Thank you. The rest of you Guards, fan out, find whoever else is lurking in what's left of my walls. [The GUARDS leave] 

#### GAMMON

You know, Baker, you'll probably find this strange, but I missed this! You and I, vying for Alestes' allegiance. I concede, it was a shame she chose you... But God knows the young must make their own mistakes to learn from them. 

#### MARY

Wise words from the likes of you. 

#### GAMMON

I won't tell you to be quiet again, Mary. 

#### MARY

Good. Don't. 

#### GAMMON

And after the year she's had, I'm sure Alestes has had more than enough time to reconsider her... unfortunate decision. 

#### BAKER

You think she wants to swan around in London with you? 

#### GAMMON

God, no! She'll stay out here, inherit my fleet, keep my interests alive, just in case I ever need them again. Go ahead, have at it while we wait. 

#### BAKER

Have at what? 

#### GAMMON

I expect some sort of [puts on Glaswegian accent] " you don't own her!" type speech! 

#### BAKER

Alestes speaks for herself. 

#### GAMMON

Uh-huh. ...Well? Don't stop there. Oh go on, Baker. I bet you've always wanted to tell me to go frig myself with a sharp instrument! Now's your chance! No? Really? God, how dull. I could force you, of course. Not even a flicker of fear. Well, you can't say I didn't have a good old stab at asking you for your final words. I really, really did not enjoy your presence aboard my ship, Baker, and I'm glad I get to kill you myself. 

#### NOOR

BakerBAKER Shh, it's fine. 

#### GAMMON

Now, how do you want this? Gun to the back of the head? [GAMMON cocks the gun] 

#### GAMMON (CONT'D)

We could build some stocks, get a noose... 

#### MARY

Just shoot him and get it over with, Graham. 

#### ALESTES

(distant, calling over, breathless) 

#### STOP!



#### GAMMON

Ah. Earlier than expected. That Anh really is not good at her job. 

#### ALESTES

Let them go, Gammon. 

#### GAMMON

So soft, now, Alestes. And for what? A couple of nobodies and a pathetic old man? ...What, no defending their honour? 

#### ALESTES

They don't matter to you. I do. Nothing I say changes that. 

#### GAMMON

Guilty as charged. 

#### ALESTES

So let's trade. They go free, I re-join your crew. 

#### GAMMON

You'd really do that, for them? 

#### ALESTES

I don't have all day. 

#### GAMMON

And what's to stop you from running away again, hm? Breaking contract to go 'straight'. 

#### ALESTES

You own half the ports this side of the world, Gammon. Where would I run? Who would have me. 

#### GAMMON

Well, I can't say that I'm complaining -- I certainly get the better end of this deal. Run along, Baker. Shame I can't kill you, but... I'm sure watching her choose me is punishment enough. 

#### BAKER

Alestes- 

#### GAMMON

Ah, ah, didn't you just tell me that she can speak for herself? She's made a trade, now remove your ship-stain friends from my lawn and piss off. 

#### ALESTES

Get them to safety, Baker. 

#### BAKER

AlestesALESTES Go on. I'll be fine. 

#### BAKER

Noor, do you think you can... 

#### NOOR

Yeah. I'll carry Inez. [NOOR picks up INEZ] 

#### SIVA

[From a distance] AaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! SIVA breaks through the tree line. 

#### NOOR

Siva?? 

#### SIVA



#### EVERYONE LAY YOUR WEAPONS DOWN!!



#### GAMMON

Or what? 

#### SIVA

Or, or I'll throw this!! 

#### GAMMON

A turtle shell? 

#### NOOR

The other bomb ALESTES You gave him bombs?! 

#### GAMMON

...let's just calm down, hey, lad. 

#### SIVA

Not until you free my friends! 

#### GAMMON

They're free to go. 

#### SIVA

I don't believe you! I don't believe anything you say! 

#### GAMMON

So, what? You'll blow us up, with them along for the ride? 

#### SIVA

I'll blow up the store room you've filled with ammo. No more Estate. 

#### MARY

Come now childSIVA YOU BE QUIET "MARY", if that's even your real name! 

#### ALESTES

Let's start by taking a deep breath... 

#### SIVA

Ooh acting the Captain now, are we?! Where was that when you were slagging off my Nani?? 

#### ALESTES

Siva, it was a ploy to get you out of there! 

#### SIVA

That's what you'd like me to believe, isn't it! [Click. A flintlock pistol cocks] 

#### GAMMON

Do not shoot, Mary, I want him alive. 

#### MARY

I don't give a damn what you want, Graham, I won't let him destroy what's left of this house! 

#### GAMMON

I will not allow you to ruin my plans with your disobedience any further! 

#### MARY

And what about my plans, Graham? 

#### GAMMON

My plans, your plans, what's the use in this pedanticSIVA 

#### AAAHHHHHH BE QUIET!!!!!!



#### ALESTES

Siva, let's talk about this on the shipSIVA Apologise for what you said about her! 

#### ALESTES

Fine! Yes! I'm sorry, Nani! Now let's put the shell down and[SIVA throws the bomb -- ALL cry as it comes towards them -- but it lands with an undramatic splat in the mud] 

#### GAMMON

Thank God for a bad throwing arm. 

#### ALESTES

What the HELL are you doing, throwing it over here?! We're on YOUR SIDE! 

#### SIVA

Don't SHOUT at me!

#### MARY

Enough! [Silence] 

#### MARY (CONT'D)

Siva, come here. 

#### SIVA

... No. 

#### MARY

Fine. 

#### ALESTES



#### SIVA -- GET DOWN- !

[MARY fires at SIVA. ALESTES jumps in front of him]

#### GAMMON

You SHOT ALESTES! 

#### MARY

I was AIMING for the boy!! 

#### SIVA

Captain!? 

#### ALESTES

Don't shriek at me Siva, I'm fine. It's barely... a scratch.... [ALESTES collapses]

#### BAKER (CONT'D)

(to himself) She's alright, she'll be all right. Siva, get some cloth, I'll stem the blood flow. [SIVA rips his shirt -- BAKER carefully turns ALESTES over. Plate shards fall out of her inner pocket] 

#### SIVA

What -- why was carrying a plate in her coat?! 

#### GAMMON

Alestes, is sheSIVA Don't come any closer!! 

#### GAMMON

Some weapon. 

#### SIVA

It's sharp enough to gut you! 

#### GAMMON

It's a shard of plate, boy. Put it down before you hurt yourself. [There's a distant bell clanging] 

#### BAKER

What now? 

#### SIVA

That's the British alarm! They'll be able toOh no, they're going to -- oh no. 

#### MARY

#### GAMMON

I... I need to make sure that AlestesMARY You are this close to the end of your ridiculous plot, Graham. I have jumped when you told me to jump, and I have danced when you told me to dance.

#### EXT. NETAOANSOM -- DECK



#### INEZ

The alarm's sounding. 

#### BAKER

Great, you're up, come with me. 

#### NOOR

Kedge anchor's down. 

#### BAKER

Good job -- get to warping us out. Siva get that jib unfurled, when I'm back up deck we'll brace and get out of here. Don't just stare, go! 

#### NOOR

Aye, Baker. 

#### BAKER

Siva! 

#### SIVA



#### I-IBAKER

Sails first, breakdown later. Inez, with me! 

#### INEZ

Shouldn't I help withBAKER Grab your taxidermy tools and meet me in the sickbay. 

#### INEZ

Oh- no- Baker, we need to get her to a surgeonBAKER Get us sailing, Noor! 

#### NOOR

Aye aye! [BAKER brings ALESTES down into the hold] 

#### INEZ

The soldiers, they'll come straight here once they find out we were the ones who blew the place upBAKER Better not waste our lead by dallying, then. 

#### INEZ

And then Gammon and his fleetBAKER Gammon's no longer a problem. But his fleet, yes. That's why we need to hurry. Go on, get your tools! [INEZ obeys BAKER rolls the door of the sick bay open] 

####  INT. NETAOANSOM -- HOLD -- SICK BAY

[BAKER lays ALESTES on the table, careful] 

#### BAKER

I've got you, Alestes. We'll get through this, like we always do. [INEZ enters] 

#### BAKER (CONT'D)

Clean the wound. Get as many of those plate shards out, any debris. The more we can prevent infection, the better. Watch her like a hawk. [BAKER starts to leave] 

#### INEZ

Wait, where are you going?! 

#### BAKER

We need to go, Inez. I need to brace the mast. 

#### INEZ

But I don't know how to- 

#### BAKER

You've got this, Inez. I believe in you. [BAKER leaves] 

#### INEZ

You've got this, Inez. You've got this. 

####  INT. NETAOANSOM -- DAY

[The ship is sailing at a clip] 

#### INEZ

- but to have been unconscious like this for days, now? 

#### NOOR

If it was an infection, you'd think there would be some kind of smell, or fever... 

#### INEZ

Maybe there was some ...poison on the bullet? 

#### SIVA

No. She looked bad, before the bullet hit her. And then -- after -- she was still standing. But it looked like she was convulsing. 

#### NOOR

And now the shallow breathing... the heart flutters... 

#### INEZ

I bet you Baker knows, but he's been keeping it from us. Trying to make her seem stronger than she is, you know. Prevent mutinies. 

#### NOOR

Now is not the time for conspiracies. 

#### INEZ

Keeping himself busy, so we can't ask him questionsNOOR He is worried, and he is panicking; he is not being purposefully deceitful. 

#### INEZ

You've always had a soft spot for him. 

#### SIVA

Isn't there something you could do, Inez? 

#### INEZ

I'm a taxidermist, not a damned physician. And what's she ever done for us, anyway. 

#### SIVA

She's come to save me, every time. INEZ makes an unimpressed sound. 

#### NOOR

... We can't just watch her slip away like this. We have to find her someone who can help. 

#### INEZ

And where do you suggest we go? When word gets out that we attacked the GovernorNOOR We don't know that it will. Anh and Mary might keep it under wraps. 

#### INEZ

Or, they might do the exact opposite of that and prevent us from docking anywhere off the coast of Asia! Pensive silence. The door rolls open. 

#### BAKER

...Siva. 

#### SIVA

Uh, yes, Baker? 

#### BAKER

Take these. [BAKER hands over maps, SIVA pages through them] 

#### SIVA

The Atlantic -- and the Caribbean? 

#### BAKER

You're on navigation. Plot us the quickest route West. 

#### SIVA

I don't know how toBAKER Tools are on the Captain's desk. You're smart, you'll figure it out. 

#### SIVA

Oh. Uh. Aye, sir. 

#### BAKER

Noor, Inez, with me. 

#### NOOR & INEZ

... aye, Baker. 

#### 12. EXT. JAMAICA -- ELIZABETH'S HOUSE -- EVENING

[BAKER walks the path to ELIZABETH's house and knocks on the door] 

#### ELIZABETH

You again, cousin. 

#### BAKER

You remember me. 

#### ELIZABETH

I remember the trouble that one gave me. ... Come on in out the rain, then. Let's save ourselves a Captain. [The sounds of a storm rises -- and then, mixing with it, a calming voice;] 

#### ZHU ANRAN

Hey hey, little carp Flying through the river there Watch how she swims 

#### ZHU ANRAN & NDILISWA

Underneath sun-warmed streams Dazzling collar made from beads Dancing dancing dance up stream... Face painted white and gold Over cheeks and above eyes Dancing dancing dance up stream 

#### ZHU ANRAN

Watch how she swims Dancing dancing dance up stream Dancing dancing dance up stream Dancing, dancing, dance...
