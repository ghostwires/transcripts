##### [Show Theme -- Intro]



#### ALEX

Hello again and welcome to episode 13 of the Rusty Quill gaming podcast. I'm your host and GM Alex Newall and with me as ever, I have: 

#### LYDIA

Lydia Nicholas. 

#### BEN

Ben Meredith. 

#### BRYN

Bryn Monroe. 

#### JAMES

James Ross. 

#### ALEX

And who are you all playing? 

#### JAMES

Sir Bertrand 'Bertie' MacGuffingham, a newly minted human statue. (Group laughter) 

#### BRYN

I'm playing Hamid the Halfling spell caster. I've been describing him as a sorcerer because that's the out of character description, but I think it's clearer if I start making it obvious that that's not an in-character label, yes? 

#### BEN

Zolf Smith, a dwarven cleric and also apparently personal development coach. (Group laughter) 

#### LYDIA

Sasha Rackett, who is in her slimy underworld element right now. 

#### ALEX

As a quick recap, obviously you guys are tracking down the people who messed around with the Simulacrum at Eddison's house and killed a lot of people. 

#### LYDIA

Yeah, we did. 

#### ALEX

You traced it to Other London but got ambushed when you were trying to track down the equipment where they bought it, got taken to ... 

#### LYDIA

I have a coincidental same name. 

#### ALEX

You got taken to basically the Rackett headquarters, where you were made an offer... 

#### LYDIA

Coincidence, yeah! 

#### ALEX

And you were made an offer you can't refuse that included a ring of magical origins that was given to... 

#### BRYN

A mysterious magical ring. Oh my God, a Halfling's wearing a magic ring guys. 

#### JAMES

I did wonder about that. (Group laughter) 

#### LYDIA

Say what ? 

#### ALEX

And you guys got hold of a map to a compound where apparently according to Barrett, the head of the Rackets... 

#### BEN

Who's very trustworthy probably. 

#### ALEX

He's soooo trustworthy. 

#### LYDIA

We didn't really interrogate that did we? 

#### ALEX

Sooooooooo trusty........ 

#### LYDIA

Yeah. 

#### BEN

I think he was about that far away from killing us.... so I wasn't really that keen to interrogate! (Group laughter) 

#### ALEX

And, ooh actually Sasha found out some more info about Brock from his... 

#### LYDIA

I did. 

#### ALEX

...incredibly sinister seven foot... 

#### LYDIA

He's in Paris and he's happy enough. 

#### ALEX

...friend. 

#### BRYN

...in the cloak... 

#### ALEX

In the cloak. 

#### BEN

The dementer, right? He's a dementer. 

#### ALEX

Oh, well you know. (laughter) And, you guys tracked it down, went through Rackett territory, got some eel keesh on the way? 

#### LYDIA

Yaaaaaaaaayy ! 

#### ALEX

And... 

#### JAMES

Invented the eel keesh... (laughter) 

#### ALEX

You did, you did, you invented eel keesh... 

#### JAMES

Keesh-a-la... 

#### LYDIA

Eel? 

#### JAMES

No, what's his name, Grieg? Greg? 

#### LYDIA

Oh, Gragg. 

#### BEN

Gragg. 

#### JAMES

Keesh-a-la-Gragg. Keesh eel-a-la-Gragg. 

#### EVERYONE

Ooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww. 

#### ALEX

And nonetheless after Sasha scouted out the area she found that they could probably draw away some of the guards and there wouldn't be too much left. And then although his charm person failed, Hamid has nonetheless succeeded in drawing both guards... 

#### BRYN

With my natural charm. 

#### ALEX

...with your natural charm, succeeded in drawing both guards to a little nook hidden away. Whereupon they're looking for a statue covered in eagles. At which point... 

#### LYDIA

Falcons. 

#### JAMES

Falcons. 

#### ALEX

Falcons, I keep saying that. 

#### BEN

How dare you? 

#### ALEX

...covered in falcons and -- where we left off -- a certain player, namely James, had managed to pull out of somewhere a natural 20 on a disguise check to look like a statue for... 

#### JAMES

I thought, we don't need it, it's not critical to combat or the player things. I'll just roll a 20 now. I thought, 'why not?' 

#### LYDIA

Why would I have it in combat... 

#### JAMES

Yeah. 

#### LYDIA

...when I could roll several one's? 

#### JAMES

Just the character flavour, one and want to do it now... 

#### ALEX

So describe to me then what your disguise entailed and how, how your pose -- let's be honest -- that's an important factor... 

#### JAMES

That is an important factor. Well obviously, in an ideal world, if I was posing as a statue, I'd like to be sat on a horse because -- with the horse's leg raised -- which would imply that I was victorious in battle. However... 

#### ALEX

Something to aspire to. 

#### JAMES

I know. There are no, no horses down here. So... 

#### BRYN

That would have been, that would have been more of a struggle to make up. To pretend to be a statue... 

#### JAMES

Yeah. 

#### BRYN

...in the time available... 

#### LYDIA

You have to roll for the horse. 

#### BRYN

Yeah, he. 

#### JAMES

Yeah, I'd build a horse out of filth. (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

Okay. So, what Bertie has done is he's, he's kind of, he's buffed up his armour with his standard armour polish that he has whenever he's going somewhere a bit fancy, and he needs to wear his dress armour. 

#### LYDIA

Ha ha ha. 

#### JAMES

He's pulled his helmet down and polished that up, super loads, also he's got a little bit, because the only real gap in the armour when the helmet is down -- is the eyes. So he's just kind of put a little bit over his eyelids as well, so that it looks like it's a consistent... 

#### ALEX

Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh. 

#### JAMES

So even if somebody were to stare right in -- because this is a 20... 

#### ALEX

Oh yeah, like you... 

#### JAMES

This is amazing, this is an amazing disguise. He's done that. 

#### LYDIA

Yes. 

#### JAMES

He's also, he's just kind of rubbed a little bit of, just muck, just into the like the grain of the armour to suggest that this statue's kind of been here a while and is an... 

#### ALEX

Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh. 

#### JAMES

...established part of, and it just, it looks a tiny bit weathered as a result of that because of the muck, and... 

#### LYDIA

I can imagine that would hurt, Bertie. 

#### JAMES

Well, he's not pleased about it. Nut nobody can see his grimace. (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

And, at this point as well the, he's also, he's got his sword drawn and he's kind of standing in a kind of a guard's type pose with sword up and shield out. 

#### BEN

How's his falcon lamp? 

#### JAMES

I've raised it, so as to draw them in. 

#### ALEX

Oh, so you're a beacon? 

#### BEN ?

Like an angler fish! 

#### JAMES

Like an angler fish, yes. (Laughter) 

#### BEN

A big falconesque angler... 

#### JAMES

It's going to be exactly like that. I'm going to bait the two guards then I'm going to absorb their bodies... (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

...leaving certain essential elements of them dangling on the outside. 

#### BEN

For use later? 

#### JAMES

Say again. For use later? When required. 

#### ALEX

So, what is everyone else doing? 

#### BEN

Okay. So I am hidden behind a rock that is just behind the pool that Bertie is standing in. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BEN

It's just about within trident range, so if they start to inspect him by getting in the pool I can give them a bit of a prod. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BEN

And I've braced myself, so I am looking to charge into them... 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BEN

...using my tiny, tiny, move range. 

#### ALEX

And Hamid? 

#### BRYN

I have taken my own picnic portion of eel keesh out of my pocket and borrowed Sasha's as well and I'm standing hidden in some shadows with, with an eel keesh portion in each hand... (laughter) 

#### BRYN

...ready to... 

#### BEN

Keesh bombs. 

#### ALEX

And Sasha? 

#### LYDIA

I am folded into a tiny crevice in a rock. If you think of the, the, the journey that the guards are taking. Like a sort of road, the rock and pool that Bertie's in is on one side of it and the rock that we're on is on the other. So they should pass by -- I'm hoping, and I am quite good at disguise -- that they will come, they will come past and see the beacon, turn to that and then... 

#### ALEX

So, can... 

#### LYDIA

...stab them in the back. 

#### BRYN

Sasha and I are hopefully well concealed. 

#### LYDIA

Mmm. 

#### ALEX

Can I get a stealth check from everyone that isn't Bertie? (laughter) 

#### ALEX

Bearing in mind you're getting enormous bonuses for having time to prepare and knowing where they're coming from, and all kinds of things. (several dice rolls) 

#### LYDIA

Err, 15. 

#### ALEX

Yeah? 

#### BEN



#### ALEX

Right. (laughter) 

#### BRYN

Okay. So, his spell roll is 2, but he is literally behind a rock. 

#### ALEX

Like I said, you're getting enormous bonuses. 

#### BRYN

Yeah. 

#### ALEX

It's just in case it was... 

#### BRYN

I have 15 as well. 

#### ALEX

Okay, sure. So, the guards start approaching and they -- at first they're being quite careful -- until they see the light shining from the beacon. At which point they kind of lose their cautiousness on just sheer curiosity, and then see -- coming round the corner -- and see this sort of ancient monolith of a man encased in bronze or gold or something, waist like, knee deep in muck but nonetheless it's like a, it's like a beacon from an older time; a testament to the greatness of man, staring and guarding the Thames from those that would come. 

#### JAMES

Oh, stop. (Group laughter) 

#### ALEX

And yeah, they go up straight away. You hear them muttering to each other, "Oh, he's, he's actually telling the truth, oh." And then just, they go right up; like right up. They leave the dogs sort of unattended and they're just sort of sniffing around. One of them goes, "Oh, go on" "Alright." So one of them -- he sort of wades in just a little bit, up to the knee -- literally right up, right up to the statue and starts you know, [ding dingk]. Huh huh. Goes next to him, puts his arms around it as if, like if there was a photo, they'd be taking a photo. 

#### LYDIA

Taking an I-photo. 

#### BEN

At which point I will take a five foot step. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BEN

And just ramming my trident into his spine. 

#### LYDIA

Oooohhhh. You're having such a lovely day. 

#### BEN

Well, if you're a guard and you get distracted by a fabulous falcon statue there... 

#### ALEX

I am going to allow you do something here -- slightly retcon-ing -- which I shouldn't do, but you would have had enough time. I'll allow all of you to have coordinated. 

#### BRYN

Yeah. 

#### ALEX

Everyone roll me initiative, just so I know the order that you're in. (dice rolling) 

#### LYDIA



#### 17.



#### ALEX

17 to, anyone higher than 17? 

#### BRYN

No. 

#### JAMES

No. 

#### BEN

I'm back on form with five, so. 

#### ALEX

Lower than 17? 

#### BRYN

Err, 10. 

#### JAMES

Seven, if you include my bonus. 

#### LYDIA

But, if this is something we've coordinated to... 

#### ALEX

It's just the order that things go off on. 

#### BRYN

Yeah. So we will all get an entire round of actions... 

#### LYDIA

Mm hmm. 

#### BRYN

That's the surprise round. Then there will a normal round, where you are likely to still act before them... 

#### LYDIA

Hurray ! 

#### BRYN

...again. 

#### ALEX

And would get your sneak attack -- again. 

#### BRYN

Yes. 

#### LYDIA

Yay! I like stabbing. 

#### ALEX

(chuckles) Once it goes off it's really nice. So I've got Sasha, Hamid, Bertie was on 10? 

#### JAMES

Seven. 

#### ALEX

Seven. 

#### BEN

And I was on five. 

#### ALEX

Okay. (dice rolling) 

#### BEN

From the look on your face these aren't the brightest guards? 

#### ALEX

These are not the brightest guards, and have rolled incredibly poorly on their initiative. 

#### BEN

Yeah. So we're not looking at the cream of the crop I think... 

#### BRYN

Ace are gonna die. 

#### BEN

Yeah, and they sent, sent those guys out on the away mission and these are the guys that stayed behind. 

#### ALEX

Okay. So, Zolf gives a signal. 

#### LYDIA

Yay. 

#### ALEX

And, Sasha's quickest off the mark. What do you do? 

#### LYDIA

So he's stabbed them in the spine? 

#### BRYN

No. 

#### ALEX

No, not yet. 

#### BRYN

This is all happening simultaneously. 

#### LYDIA

Right. 

#### BEN

So you, you can... 

#### LYDIA

I want to hold on. 

#### BRYN

...hold an action until I start. 

#### LYDIA

Yeah. 

#### BRYN

You can run up to him and stab him in the back now. The whole point of the surprise of it is he will not have noticed you yet... 

#### BEN

Oh yeah he, he will still be getting snuck-attacked. 

#### BRYN

He will get snuck, sneak attack. 

#### LYDIA

Oh okay. 

#### BEN

Yeah. 

#### LYDIA

Cool. So I guess, I guess I have to run past the dog? 

#### ALEX

The dog is in surprise round and can't do anything either. 

#### BRYN

Yeah, they can't take an attack of opportunity... 

#### ALEX

I would... 

#### LYDIA

Woo, woof woof ! 

#### ALEX

I would recommend charging... 

#### LYDIA

Yeah? 

#### ALEX

...because it gives you a bonus to your attack. 

#### LYDIA

Cool. 

#### ALEX

You can cover the distance, it's a straight line... 

#### BRYN

Yeah. 

#### ALEX

...it's easy, it's easy terrain -- the bit that you've picked -- is easy terrain 

#### LYDIA

Yeah. 

#### ALEX

So you automatically -- because you've had to move -- you only get the one attack, but nonetheless you gain sneak attack damage, and you're getting... 

#### BRYN

And you're getting plus two on the attack. 

#### ALEX

A plus two just to hit him. 

#### LYDIA

Right. Okay, just to hit him. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### LYDIA

Okay. (dice rolling) 

#### LYDIA

12 plus the two, 14. 

#### ALEX

It's a hit. 

#### LYDIA

Ah, thank goodness. 

#### BRYN

What was your normal attack bonus? 

#### BEN

...plus what I've got here, it's a one I think? 

#### ALEX

Yeah, so you're up at 15. 

#### LYDIA

Yeah one, so 15. 

#### BRYN

Yeah. 

#### LYDIA

Right. 

#### ALEX

So you get your... 

#### BRYN

And he's flat footed. 

#### ALEX

...and he is flat footed, so that means he's taking penalties on top because of the flanking and everything. This is how you do rogueing. 

#### LYDIA

So then I... 

#### BEN

D4 and D6. 

#### LYDIA

D4 and D6. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. (dice rolling) 

#### LYDIA

Ooh, oh for goodness sake Sasha. Ah, that's four. 

#### BEN

And you do get your dirty fighter bonus, so you... 

#### BRYN

Yeah, negate your, cancelling the strength... 

#### BEN

Cancelling the strength. 

#### ALEX

Okay. At which point... 

#### BEN

Bearing in mind you get to do that another two times. 

#### LYDIA

Oh right. 

#### ALEX

Oh yeah, before any of them can do anything. 

#### BEN

Because you've got two swords now, or two daggers and you're there. 

#### LYDIA

Oh yeah, yeah. 

#### ALEX

Hamid? 

#### BRYN

I step a couple of steps out of cover towards where all the action is happening. 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BRYN

And I whistle. I can't whistle in real life, but Hamid can. (whistling) (laughter) 

#### ALEX

Sure, you whistle. 

#### BRYN

I whistle... 

#### LYDIA

I'll whistle for you. 

#### BRYN

...and I just gently toss -- I've got a eel keesh... 

#### ALEX

Mm hmm. 

#### BRYN

Keesh-a-la-Gragg, in each hand. I just toss them forward. 

#### ALEX

Ah ha. You are not even going to see a reaction from the dogs yet. 

#### BEN

They're too confused. (laughter) 

#### LYDIA

Woof ? 

#### ALEX

Bertie, the human statue. 

#### BEN

(singing) It's Bertie. (laughter) 

#### BEN

Bertie, Bertie the human statue. (laughter) 

#### JAMES

What adventures will Bertie the human statue... 

#### BEN

Crush a man's head! (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

Oh, I was going to go for Bertie the human statue, but I mean what of this... inevitably he's going to stand still because he's a statue. (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

(sings) Bertie, Bertie, Bertie the human statue. 

#### ALEX

Best episode ever. 

#### JAMES

Yeah. Next episode. (sings) Bertie, Bertie... (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

Right. Sorry, it's just, it's a whole series just about like copper oxidisation. (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

It's really... 

#### ALEX

Educative! 

#### JAMES

...hard hitting stuff. 

#### BEN ?

It's the kind of thing they show in physics class or like... 

#### LYDIA

Attack the men! 

#### BRYN

Take your attack. 

#### JAMES

Okay. So, yeah. So I am going to unleash a mighty bellow... (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

...and attack... 

#### LYDIA

Roar play that. 

#### JAMES

Yeah. Rooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr !! (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

MacGuffingham's aliiiiiivvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeee ! (Group laughter) 

#### JAMES

And I'm going to attack (rolls dice), I think that's probably going to be... 

#### BRYN

You'll get a flanking bonus on that one. 

#### JAMES

Oh, I'll have the one on the flanking bonus then, yeah. 

#### ALEX

So, which one -- just point for me? Oh yeah. 

#### JAMES

That one, I believe? Yeah. 

#### LYDIA

He's going to be finished by the time I get to use my... 

#### BEN

You'll get guy who's still... 

#### JAMES

So 3 plus my attack bonus which is 4 which is 7. 

#### BRYN

Plus your flanking bonus takes it up to 9 but it's still probably not good enough against his flat footedness. 

#### ALEX

Yeah so Bertie gives a huge roarrrr and does a huge swing and then proceeds to go, oh no, polish in the eye, polish in the eye and then just happens to swing and miss him. And after that Zolf? 

#### BEN

Whoop! 

#### ALEX

Yep 

#### BEN

That whoop was my five foot step guys. Stab! Get spined! (rolls dice) Do I miss? That might be a miss. Yeah that's...8. 

#### ALEX

8. It is a miss. 

#### LYDIA

You guys! 

#### ALEX

She's carrying you guys. 

#### BEN

We get another go? 

#### ALEX

At which point [panicking noise], the guards, the one that's next to Bertie from the bellow literally falls over prone, just in the water just [yelling noise]. The one who got stabbed in the back is terrified and just screams ghosts, ghosts! One of the dogs hears the whistle and faces the complete wrong direction having got a 1 in its initiative and the other dog turns and...this is not in its turn but I'll do it anyway. 

#### BEN

Makes a terrifying will save for quiche. 

#### ALEX

Fails its will save and just goes "quiche"! Doesn't go for it yet until its turn. It's just noticed it and is entranced. 

#### BEN

Transfixed by quiche. 

#### ALEX

Sasha, you're up again. 

#### LYDIA

I'm going to stab this dude twice. 

#### ALEX

Take both attacks with all of the bonuses in the world. 

#### LYDIA

I need to roll to hit, right? 

#### BEN

2 times to hit. 

#### LYDIA

(rolls dice) A 14 and that's a 5 which... 

#### ALEX

That would be a 6 

#### LYDIA

Yeah. So fifteen and a six. 

#### ALEX

One of them hits so you get your... 

#### BRYN

You're getting flanking as well, like you're getting lots of bonuses but the fight probably still isn't good enough. 

#### ALEX

Yeah it's closed but isn't quite enough. 

#### LYDIA

(rolls dice) Ooh 8! 

#### ALEX

He's down! He's down. 

#### LYDIA

Yay! I killed a dude. Well not killed but knocked him down. 

#### ALEX

He's near death. Tell you what describe the blow for me. 

#### LYDIA

Fortunately no one I think is looking her straight in the face because it's quite an ugly grin, stabling delight as...she's run across and shanked this guy very quickly, sort of beneath some ribs which you know, did some damage but it didn't go right the way down. When she saw him jump up without like really paying attention to her [stabbing noise] under his thick level jacket. 

#### ALEX

Presume that's what it is. Hamid, you're up. One of them is already down. 

#### LYDIA

(whispering) Blood everywhere. 

#### BRYN

I am going to hold my action. 

#### ALEX

Good call. Bertie you're up. 

#### JAMES

I'm going to hack at the prone man. (laughing) 

#### ALEX

Not even offering him surrender. Just hacking. Go for it. Give me the roll. 

#### LYDIA

Wait! Maybe we can ask them about what's going on inside. 

#### JAMES

(rolls dice) I hack at the prone man. 7 +... 

#### ALEX

It's a hit. I don't... 

#### BRYN

With all the bonuses 

#### ALEX

It's a hit. It's so stacked against them. 

#### JAMES

So damage roll is D10 +3 

#### BEN

So this is what happens when we got the drop on people. 

#### JAMES

6 + 3 is 9. 

#### ALEX

9. He's still alive and not unconscious but he has just been attacked by a living statue with, of creepy origins that doesn't seem to be human. Just going 

##### [bubbling noise] and just took a sword to him.



#### JAMES

I've taken a good slice off his leg. 

#### ALEX

Zolf, you're up. 

#### BEN

Right put my trident, just drop my trident to the side, grab the guy in the water that's just been attacked by Bertie, pull him out shouting, stay down and you won't be hurt. 

#### ALEX



##### [panicking noise] ok, sorry, sir, sorry.



#### BEN

And if I can get him out I'll just basically lean in with my shield, just keep it down. 

#### ALEX

Sure, meanwhile the first dog that couldn't figure out where it was proceeds to trot off looking for a quiche that it couldn't discern because it's an idiot and rolled a natural 1. 

#### BEN

Silly dog! The quiche is different... 

#### ALEX

The other one which got its initiative roll which wasn't particularly good anyway and then did a crippling awful will save against your quiche, proceeds to go over and just nom on some quiche. 

#### LYDIA

I look back and like, I wanted that quiche. 

#### ALEX

At which point I'm going to call an end to combat because.... 

#### BRYN

I'm going to ask Bertie to come over and help me with the dogs because he has handle animal. 

#### JAMES

I do have handle animal, yeah. 

#### ALEX

Oh yeah you can totally use it now. So... 

#### BRYN

This is the time Bertie! 

#### ALEX

So one of them is down and appears to be bleeding out should you decide to stop it. The other one is just pinned down going [whimpering noise] sorry. He's not doing anything. One of the dogs is wandering off and another one is chowing down. 

#### BEN

Alright Sasha if you get over here, keep this guy subdued, I'll get the other one. 

#### LYDIA

I walk around. 

#### ALEX

Sure 

#### BRYN

Make him drop his weapons. 

#### BEN

Sure, yes. 

#### LYDIA

I lean on the shield and I hold the knife to his throat. 

#### BEN

I'll kick the sword out of his hand... 

#### ALEX

He's...he's already thrown his sword away going sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. 

#### LYDIA

Actually I've got...what have I got, do I have rope? Yeah. I want to tie him up. We'll pass there and you've got rope so you can hand me some. 

#### BEN

Yeah I'll hand you some. 

#### LYDIA

I start tying up his hands... 

#### ALEX

We'll say that you take 10 because the guy is not going to be struggling. 

#### BEN

I will go to this guy and... 

#### LYDIA

And I gag him. 

#### BEN

...just stabilise him. 

#### ALEX

Yeah he's stabilised but unconscious, very, very as in having done the maths. Incredibly close to death but stable now. 

#### BEN

Drag him around to his friend or associate I suppose. 

#### ALEX

Yeah and the one dog that was wandering off has started turning around and coming back. 

#### BRYN

I will attract his attention with the eel pie. 

#### LYDIA

Ooh, who's a good doggie? Who's a good doggie?! 

#### ALEX

Sure. Bertie what are you doing? 

#### JAMES

I'm going to talk to the one that's already chowing down on the quiche. Hello, who's a good boy. Who's a good boy? You're a good boy. Hello. (mumbles of affection) 

#### ALEX

Ok give me a handle animal check 

#### JAMES

Can I take twice as long to... 

#### ALEX

Yes you can.... 

#### JAMES

...pomp... 

#### ALEX

You can pomp and pageantry a dog. I will allow this. As broken as it is because what you're doing...I'll rule that what you're doing is you're making yourself look the most alpha of all the people it could ever encounter. 

#### JAMES

That's what I'm going. So I'm at +5 for this. (rolls dice) 14. 19. 

#### BRYN

+1 for pomp and pageantry. 

#### JAMES

Oh yeah +1. 20. 

#### ALEX

What are you trying to make it do? 

#### JAMES

So I am trying to tame the dog, make it be our lovely friend because its previous master clearly was rubbish so I want to make it. 

#### LYDIA

So we keep the dog. 

#### BEN

Are you going to turn into Bertie Doolittle. 

#### JAMES

A little bit. 

#### BRYN

We might have to tie them up over here while we... 

#### JAMES

Yeah, keeping the dog distracted and playing with it and trying to transfer its loyalty away from a slightly rubbish master through simple acts of kindness. 

#### LYDIA

Like stabbing its master. 

#### JAMES

Like stabbing its master. Yeah. 

#### ALEX

So having looked it up briefly, the handle animal thing is a bit obtuse when it comes to, you know, getting hostile like guard dogs or whatever on your side. That said, I will totally allow it. With the 20. This massive bull mastiff proceeds to go flop onto its back and just be [dog noise] 

#### JAMES

Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? You are! You are! [dog talking noise] You are! 

#### ALEX

The other one starts coming back and it may go either way. You can't tell if it's going to be hostile or not yet. 

#### JAMES

Can I attempt a similar thing on that just to sort of, calm it down. 

#### ALEX

Sure yeah. 

#### JAMES

(rolls dice) 12. I don't think I'll bother with the...because he's advancing quickly so I wouldn't have the time to... 

#### ALEX

You wouldn't have the pomp and pageantry. 

#### JAMES

12 + 5 is 17. 

#### ALEX

17. The other one comes over too. It's not nearly as enamoured with you but nonetheless it proceeds to sit down with its friend and just start munching on an eel quiche and yeah, but the first one is a little bit besotted. 

#### JAMES

Ok 

#### ALEX

A little bit besotted. 

#### JAMES

You are! You are! [dog talking noise] Say sausages. 

#### LYDIA

For the listeners at home, we cut 10 minutes of this! 

#### BEN

We actually went home and came back. 

#### LYDIA

They're still going. 

#### JAMES

There's a week long break between episodes, just doing this. 

#### BEN

So, yeah dump his friend down and sort of leaving you very handily with knife to throw, just step on his hand that's protruding through the weaponry and just press down and say so, using my dwarven heaviness, who do you work for? 

#### ALEX

Serpentines. 

#### BEN

Serpentines ah? Yeah have they been getting up to anything recently? 

#### ALEX

Yeah 

#### BEN

Yeah? What have they been getting up to? 

#### ALEX

Loads of stuff. 

#### BEN

Loads of stuff? 

#### ALEX

Yeah 

#### BEN

Any particular stuff? Maybe in upper London. 

#### ALEX

Oh yeah loads of stuff. Anything that you want. 

#### BEN

Anything that I want? That's actually not what I want. I want you to give me specifics. Now what's the most recent thing they did? Say yesterday. No, the day before yesterday. 

#### ALEX

Ah loads of stuff. Umm. Oooh, my memory is going. 

#### BEN

Just press down on his hand. 

#### ALEX

I'm going to get you to do an intimidate check. If anyone wants to aid, do so now, you're not each going to get your own intimidate check. 

#### LYDIA

I will. I have a knife at his throat. The two people with charisma... 

#### BEN

I think we're getting bonuses. 

#### JAMES

I feel like I should lend a hand but I'm busy with the dogs. 

#### ALEX

You're busy making a friend for life. 

#### BEN

Hamid, how about yourself? 

#### BRYN

I'm going to come over and be the good cop to your bad cop. 

#### ALEX

So give me the intimidate. So... 

#### LYDIA

(rolls dice) 9 -- 1 

#### ALEX

Ok so that won't be enough to aid... 

#### BEN

And that is 15 all told. 

#### ALEX

15. Let's give him a countertroll. He is not intimidated. That doesn't mean your interrogation has to stop by the way. It just means that he just won't blab and be incredibly conducive. 

#### LYDIA

I like that Sasha fails to be intimidating while she's got a knife at the guy's throat... 

#### ALEX

His attention is elsewhere. 

#### BEN

So alright, your memory's quite bad is it? 

#### ALEX

Erm yeah. 

#### BEN

So what could jog that? What could jog that? 

#### ALEX

Oh, you know...freedom 

#### BEN

Freedom yeah. Money? 

#### ALEX

Ooh yeah, money. 

#### BEN

Not being stabbed to death with a trident... 

#### BRYN

(interrupting) Hello, hello, hi! 

#### LYDIA

Or a dagger. 

#### BRYN

It's ok they're not going to hurt you, ok. We just need information. 

#### BEN

I mean I'd quite like to hurt him. 

#### LYDIA

I might hurt him. 

#### BRYN

Just give him a second. Let him calm down. I know this is stressful for you. 

#### ALEX

Yeah, no, yeah, yeah. 

#### LYDIA

It could be more stressful. 

#### BRYN

So just breathe 

#### ALEX

I would but there's a shield. 

#### BEN

She's not that heavy! 

#### BRYN

Just lean back a little. He's tied up now. It's fine. 

#### LYDIA

I lean back a little but my dagger is still on his throat. 

#### ALEX

Ow, ok. 

#### BRYN

Just back a touch. Back a touch. Come on Sasha. 

#### LYDIA

I don't know. I don't like beards like this, the stubble... 

#### ALEX

She starts shaving him?! (laughing) 

#### BEN

Aggressively shaving! 

#### LYDIA

No I just like taunting him with the dagger. 

#### BRYN

He needs to be able to talk. We just need to let him talk. Give me 20 centimetres, come on. 

#### LYDIA

Twenty...?! A centimetre. 

#### ALEX

Ok yeah thanks. 

#### BRYN

Ok just breathe. We're not here to hurt you 

#### LYDIA

I am. 

#### BRYN

We need to know... 

#### ALEX

Ok can I get you, before you do your wording to give me the diplomacy roll. Remember I'd always rather you roll then role play. 

#### BRYN

(rolls dice) 6 which is a total of, I think, 13. 

#### ALEX

Ok 

#### BRYN

Oh no 14. 

#### BEN

Not bad. 

#### ALEX

And he has rolled poorly. Role play it and get what you think is right and then I'll give you the count... 

#### LYDIA

I just really wanted a friend! 

#### BRYN

We're not here to hurt you, we just need information ok. If you don't know what your group have been up to just tell us about who's in the compound. How many people? 

#### ALEX

Well I mean there's...there used to be 4 inside but now there's 3 since Guy, yeah...well, I mean. There's 3. 

#### LYDIA

3 people or 3 guards. 

#### ALEX

Oh there's 3 people inside. 

#### BRYN

3 people. And what do you know about those people? So what are their names? 

#### ALEX

There's Guy, there's Carl and then...and then there's his brother Carlton. 

#### BRYN

So Guy, Carl and Carlton. 

#### ALEX

Err, cause, cause Jeremy left yeah. 

#### BRYN

Jeremy 

#### ALEX

Yeah. 

#### BRYN

Ok, when did Jeremy leave? 

#### ALEX

Oh well he...he left when they, you know, when they got back yesterday. 

#### BRYN

Ok do you know where they went when they left yesterday? 

#### ALEX

Jeremy? 

#### BRYN

No before, you say Jeremy left when they got back. 

#### ALEX

Oh yeah they went for the Sim...no. No I don't. 

#### BRYN

Yes you do. Come on. 

#### BEN

To be honest we did hear the first three letters of that. 

#### ALEX

The Sim... 

#### BEN

Yeah 

#### ALEX

...polmar? 

#### BEN

No 

#### LYDIA

Simul... 

#### BEN

Laaaaa....fill us in here 

#### ALEX

...crum 

#### BEN

There we go. Ok. 

#### ALEX

Yeah no, yeah, yeah. Yeah they went for the Simulacrum and then they came back with the stuff. 

#### BRYN

And then Jeremy left? 

#### ALEX

Yeah. 

#### BRYN

So did he take anything with him when he left? 

#### ALEX

Oh I don't know. Guy's gone mad though. Guy's proper angry. 

#### BRYN

So Guy and Carl... 

#### ALEX

Oh, Guy's going to kill me. 

#### BRYN

...and Carlton. 

#### ALEX

Like actually kill me. I don't mean he's going to be annoyed. I mean he's actually going to kill me. 

#### LYDIA

Welllllll , why don't I kill you first. 

#### BRYN

So well will they be? Where will the 3 of them be? 

#### ALEX

They're inside. They'll be...they'll be 

#### BRYN

In the main building? 

#### ALEX

Yeah 

#### BRYN

Will they all be in the same room? 

#### ALEX

Yeah 

#### LYDIA

How well do they fight? 

#### ALEX

You know, they're pretty good. They're like...I wanted to join and now I don't. I want to go home. 

#### BRYN

We'll take you home. Once it's all done here. We will take you home. You don't need to worry. 

#### ALEX

Is that a bluff? I'm curious. If it's not...if you believe it then... 

#### BRYN

Hamid believes it. 

#### ALEX

Then it's not a bluff. 

#### BEN

How long have you been a member of the Serpentines? 

#### ALEX

Oh, like a couple of weeks now. 

#### BEN

Did you know about their plan to get the Simulacrum beforehand? 

#### ALEX

Oh well, I mean like the Guy gave a speech. It was dead good. Dead good speech. 

#### BEN

Do you know how many people they killed to get the Simulacrum? 

#### ALEX

Ye...no. No. 

#### LYDIA

What was his speech about? What does he think it can do? What does he plan to do with it? 

#### ALEX

He doesn't plan to do anything. 

#### LYDIA

Right 

#### ALEX

Well now because that's the point innit. You know, it's like...you get rid of the devices that are taking the places of people, you know, up top and that and that way, like, you know... 

#### BRYN

Probably a zealot or a fanatic? 

#### ALEX

...like, the power comes back to us. You're an under Londoner I can tell. 

#### LYDIA

Yeah, like there was so much power here before they managed to make those machines. 

#### ALEX

That's the point right because it was like the machines that did the flood weren't it so like if you get rid of the machines then everything goes... 

#### BRYN

What's your name, friend? 

#### ALEX

I'm...I'm...hang on, I'm not an idiot. (pause) Bob. 

#### BRYN

Ok "Bob". 

#### ALEX

Right yeah Bob. He gives a sort of grin where he may actually genuinely believe he got away with that. He is not a sharp one. 

#### BRYN

So, Guy's the leader, is he? 

#### ALEX

Yeah 

#### BRYN

Ok and what type of weapon does he use? 

#### ALEX

All of them. He's got like those throwing things and like... 

#### BRYN

So, they throw fire flasks. He throws fire flasks 

#### ALEX

Yeah, yeah. He's got loads of them. Loads of them and he's got like magical stuff but I don't know what though. 

#### LYDIA

Do you know what kind of deal that these Serpentines have done to, because...there's only, what three of you? There's no way that he did this attack. Why did Barrett bring us here? 

#### BRYN

Thank you very much "Bob", we're going to have to go and deal with the others. We're going to leave you here. Tied up. 

#### ALEX

Take the statue with you. 

#### BRYN

He's coming with us. But once it's all done, we're going to come back for you and we're going to make sure that you're safe. 

#### ALEX

I promise I will be here waiting. 

#### BEN

You'll be tied up so you will be here waiting. 

#### ALEX

Oh, come on now. I can wait while I'm untied. 

#### BRYN

I'm just going to turn around and whisper to you, knock him out. 

#### LYDIA

Wait is there anything else about the compound? You've told us...so Guy, he's a good fighter and the others, nothing, they're just.... 

#### ALEX

So, you're just going to leave me here tied up like on my own. 

#### BEN

We'll be back. 

#### ALEX

But what if you're not back. 

#### LYDIA

Would you like me to do anything else to you before? 

#### ALEX

Traps! They've got traps. Yeah, you want to watch out for the traps. They use a lot of tripwires and also like they tend to set up alarms and things like that. And Guy uses magic and also make sure that you come back. 

#### LYDIA

How do we...how do we get past these traps? Is there an easy way in? 

#### ALEX

I... They brought me in because I had my own dog. 

#### LYDIA

Right. Great ok. 

#### BRYN

Do you have a key to the gate? 

#### ALEX

Er...he does. He kind of gestures to the other unconscious one who's just 

##### [unconscious noise]



#### LYDIA

I search his body for the key. 

#### ALEX

Ok yeah. I'll tell you what we'll take a break and we'll cover what you've got in a couple of minutes. 

#### LYDIA

Hurray! Searching the bodies! 

##### [BREAK]



#### ALEX

And welcome back. Ok so given that he, obviously seems fairly inexperienced and a bit naff, he's pretty well provisioned actually. 

#### LYDIA

Yay stuff. I do not necessarily tell the others what I find. 

#### ALEX

Go for it. Give me a search check on him and that'll help me determine just how much you find. If anyone wants to aid...if anyone wants to aid please do so now. 

#### BEN

I'm busy... (Lydia rolls dice) 

#### ALEX

Too late the roll's down now. 

#### LYDIA



#### ALEX

16's actually a decent roll. You find upon him a potion of cure like wounds, a smoke stick, a tanglefoot bag. It's clear to you he's wearing a Masterworks studded leather armour. 

#### LYDIA

Oooohh 

#### BRYN

Nab it. 

#### ALEX

It is mundane however... 

#### BRYN

It's actually going to be difficult to take that off. 

#### ALEX

And would not resize magically to you. So, you could...I'd allow you to get away with it but it would be quite cumbersome. 

#### LYDIA

I hold it up, Zolf does this fit you? 

#### BEN

No. 

#### LYDIA

Well, I dunno! 

#### BEN

He's 5 foot 6. 

#### ALEX

It would be trailing on the ground. 

#### LYDIA

I thought it was a belt. 

#### ALEX

No, no, no, this is full studded leather. 

#### LYDIA

Oh, right, I'm really sorry. To be fair that is the kind of awkward thing that Sasha would do. "Anyone want this?" 

#### BEN

What do you think? 

#### LYDIA

Oh sorry. 

#### ALEX

It's a lovely dress, would you like the... ok he's got five daggers 

#### LYDIA

Yeah!!! 

#### ALEX

Especially given that you left one in the marketplace. 

#### LYDIA

Yes I did. 

#### ALEX

He has a short sword. 

#### LYDIA

I don't have any use for it but I put it to the side so other people can see it. 

#### ALEX

A set of Masterwork thieves tools. 

#### LYDIA

Cool. 2x Masterwork. 

#### ALEX

Three coppers. 

#### LYDIA

Boom! 

#### BEN

Brilliant. Kerching! 

#### LYDIA

I have no money so to me that's like... 

#### ALEX

That's like three days rent. And that's it. That's everything he's got. So presumably you want to know about the smoke stick and tangle foot bag? 

#### LYDIA

Yes please. 

#### BRYN

Yes. 

#### ALEX

Sure. So just explaining it quickly, the smoke stick is another alchemical weapon. They seem to be big on those. Basically it's a wooden stick that instantly, when used, creates a thick opaque smoke when burned. The smoke fills a 10 foot cube like a fog cloud except that it's moderate or stronger wind dissipates it. So, it's consumed after one round or the smoke dissipates naturally after one minute. So, as in, once you throw the stick it gives you a smoke screen. The stick itself is gone in one round and the smoke that it creates which fills a 10 foot cube will dissipate in about a minute unless there's... 

#### LYDIA

How many rounds is that? 

#### ALEX

So, one minute is like 10 rounds. 

#### LYDIA

Right, good stuff. 

#### ALEX

So out of combat, it's ok. In combat, it's pretty darn useful. And Bryn you've got the details of the tanglefoot. 

#### BRYN

Yeah, a tanglefoot bag is really cool. It's like this grenade filled with goo and it like sticks people...it says, so the bag...when you throw the bag it comes apart and goo bursts out entangling the target and becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. 

#### LYDIA

Is it one use? 

#### BRYN

Yeah, so but it... 

#### ALEX

All of these are one use. 

#### BRYN

It creates...it's like that sort of high-pressure foam they use which hardens really quickly and they use it as like a restraint thing. 

#### LYDIA

I think both of those are things that I would keep and I would not necessarily tell people. 

#### BEN

That's fine you can choose to do that or not. 

#### LYDIA

Err, although with the health thing... 

#### ALEX

Actually, just to cut across, I will spell out when it's entangled it takes a --2 on all attack rolls, --4 to dexterity and must make a reflex save or be glued to the floor and even if it succeeds its save, it still moves at half speed unless it makes a save, it can't fly and stuff like that. It can break free with a strength check or... 

#### LYDIA

Does it kind of flanking them...if they're tangled can I come and sort of... 

#### BRYN

No. 

#### LYDIA

If they're stuck facing one direction... 

#### ALEX

The thing that you're thinking, so to get the sneak attack they'd need to lose all of their dex bonus. What this specifically says is they don't lose their dex bonus, it just gives them a really hard penalty because they deliberately don't want ropes, they just go goo, stab, goo, stab, goo, stab. But... 

#### BRYN

Because it doesn't, although it restricts their movement, it doesn't make them unaware or you. It's them being unaware that makes you really good. 

#### LYDIA

Right, cool. 

#### ALEX

So that's all of the stuff that he had upon him and you know why you're going to love me? The other guy had the same. (cheering) And I'm going to assume that you did the search for both. They both had the same equipment. 

#### LYDIA

But that means as well that I have four cure like wounds. I am going to give one of them to Hamid. 

#### BRYN

Thank you 

#### LYDIA

Because he gave me one. 

#### BEN

Actually, I did 

#### LYDIA

Did you? 

#### BRYN

We both gave you at different points... 

#### BEN

Oh, did you? 

#### LYDIA

I... only give one to Hamid (laughing) 

#### ALEX

Ok so you're all stocked up with equipment. 

#### LYDIA

Wait that means I've got 3x Masterwork thieves' tools and I've still got the other ones. I've got a lot of thieves' tools. I hold one out to Hamid. Would you like some thieves' tools? 

#### BRYN

Erm, no? (laughing) Keep them or we can just sell them back. 

#### LYDIA

Oh, and that was another five daggers, right...oh four daggers? Five? 

#### ALEX

Yup, you're drowning in daggers. 

#### LYDIA

I put out an array of daggers. Look how many daggers this one had. I take one so I now have 10 but anyone want some daggers? 

#### BEN

Nope, fair do. 

#### BRYN

No thanks. 

#### LYDIA

I gather up the daggers. I might be encumbered by daggers now. 

#### ALEX

You'll have to do the maths but I'll allow you to sort of recon some distribution of... 

#### LYDIA

I've got 14 daggers now. 

#### BRYN

Where are they all? 

#### BEN

They're not that heavy. I think you'll probably be alright. 

#### JAMES

It's like a set of steak knives when you sign up to a life insurance policy. 

#### ALEX

I'll tell you what we'll throw into the bargain that each of them was wearing a belt with sheathes for five daggers and a sword so you can... 

#### BEN

You're looking like a Final Fantasy character now. 

#### ALEX

So you can do a dual bandolier across the chest if you want. 

#### LYDIA

Oh my god yes! 

#### ALEX

Or you could do this kind of stylish where you wear one belt tightly and then one kind of loose at an angle. 

#### LYDIA

Oh yeah that is exactly... 

#### ALEX

Like Hans Solo I think? 

#### BEN

That is the Japanese game design look 

#### LYDIA

But they must be done in such a way that it doesn't rattle as I move. 

#### BEN

Ha ha. So once the hoard has been... 

#### LYDIA

That's always assuming that I have enough belts to do all that. 

#### BEN

...I will slam the guy in the head with the butt of my trident. 

#### ALEX

Bonk. 

#### BEN

Right so what do we do with these two? 

#### BRYN

Are they both tied up? 

#### BEN

I don't know about you but I'm planning to drown them. 

#### BRYN

What?! You can't do that. 

#### JAMES

I'm still playing with the dogs at this point, I don't hear any of it. 

#### BEN

Well, I mean I can. 

#### ALEX

You can choose to enter this conversation whenever you want. 

#### BEN

They killed those people. 

#### BRYN

Well not these people. I mean, part of their group did but not these specific people. 

#### BEN

They work with the organisation. You heard. And I asked him specifically. He knew how many people were going to die in the Simulacrum raid. Right? These people are responsible for those people that died. Eye for an eye. Tooth for a tooth. They deserve it. 

#### LYDIA

I shrug. 

#### BRYN

You can't...you can't just drown them after we've already beaten them, like... 

#### LYDIA

It's much easier than doing it before. 

#### BRYN

If you kill someone in a fight that's one thing but I mean, they should have a trial. We've been hired by the police. 

#### BEN

Trial?! But it's fine to kill them in a fight? 

#### BRYN

Yeah! Like if they're trying to kill you and you kill them first, that's one thing but once the fight's over you have to deliver them to the authorities. 

#### BEN

They've already done the deed. They're responsible for the deaths... 

#### BRYN

Not this person. Like, there's a difference between accessory to murder and murder. 

#### JAMES

Hello chaps. I've...look at these lovely chaps aren't they [dog talking noise] 

#### BRYN

We should tie these guys up too. Do you want to just, like tie them up to one of these rocks? 

#### JAMES

What these? 

#### BRYN

The dogs, yeah. 

#### JAMES

Tie dogs to rocks? 

#### ALEX

One of the dogs is asleep by an eaten eel pie and the other one is just pining after Bertie at his heels currently. 

#### BRYN

The safest thing to do with them... 

#### JAMES

Oh, who's a pretty boy?! 

#### BRYN

Bertie, Zolf thinks we should drown these guards. 

#### JAMES

Oh, err, well is that really necessary? 

#### BEN

They deserve it. 

#### BRYN

I disagree! 

#### BEN

They deserve it and they will make a fitting tribute to Poseidon. 

#### BRYN

What?! 

#### JAMES

Steady! 

#### LYDIA

Oh, does he give you anything in return for that? 

#### BEN

I think you're all benefitting from it. You seem happy enough that I can do it when I'm healing you. Where do you think that comes from? Hey? 

#### BRYN

I didn't realise it came from killing helpless people. 

#### BEN

Helpless maybe, responsible for the deaths of lots of people, yes. 

#### BRYN

That has to be determined in a court of law. 

#### LYDIA

If I hadn't stabbed them, they'd be stabbing you right now. 

#### BEN

Yeah the only law that I adhere to is the law of my god. And my god demands an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Justice and balance in things. The amount of people that they've killed. People that were unaware. People who were just bidding. Now they might have had lots of money, they might've been business owners and maybe not very nice peop... 

#### BRYN

That's not the issue. I don't care what the people who died are like. I'm arguing about who's responsible. This person here clearly was not part of the group that actually killed someone. 

#### BEN

Was aware of the plan. He's benefitting from the rewards reaped by the plan. Condones the plan. Works for the organisation. There was no subterfuge. I asked him, do you know how many people died and he went yeah, no. He is not taking responsibility for the things that he is responsible for. 

#### BRYN

Then he has an opportunity to learn and take responsibility and change. He... 

#### BEN

Just because he said he's sad and he wants to go home. 

#### BRYN

Look, it's very possible to do things that you didn't mean to, that you didn't agree with because someone else bullied you into it or did it without your knowledge. 

#### JAMES

Ooh struck a nerve! 

#### LYDIA

That is true, Zolf, that is, sometimes... 

#### BRYN

Exactly! Exactly! 

#### LYDIA

...sometimes people make you do, sometimes circumstance makes you do things. 

#### BEN

Being, being sorry will not bring those people back. 

#### BRYN

I know that. I'm not an idiot. 

#### BEN

Fine, fine. No. We'll wait, alright. We'll do things your way. Next time, when we have somebody who deserves it, they're going in the drink 

#### LYDIA

Sounds good. 

#### BEN

It's no different from you killing them with some of your magic spells. You're very happy to fire stuff around but as soon as you have to think about it then maybe not so much. I'm the one who saved those people in that alleyway because those thugs, maybe in retrospect might've done, but they didn't deserve to die. They came to deliver a message. These people are monsters. 

#### LYDIA

Well, that's what they said. 

#### BEN

That's what they said but that's what I had to go on. 

#### BRYN

The leaders...the leaders and the murderers inside, they are monsters. We don't know these people... 

#### BEN

Ok, fine, right compromise. If we can get those alive, I'll drown them in the Thames. They will make a fitting tribute and they deserve it. 

#### BRYN

Ok. Hamid looks conflicted as you might imagine. 

#### LYDIA

It's alright they would've killed you. That's my attempt to comfort. (laughing) 

#### ALEX

So...so, what happens next? 

#### LYDIA

Have you seen how many daggers I've got? (laughing) 

#### JAMES

Can I just ask quickly, what is the current state of my relationship with the dogs? Can I bring them with me? 

#### ALEX

One of the dogs is asleep and not particularly concerned by you. The other one is currently at heel. 

#### BEN

I think one of them has it's complicated on Facebook and the one might be... 

#### JAMES

The other one keeps sending me invites to various games. 

#### LYDIA

They're liking some really old photos of you on a beach. (laughing) 

#### JAMES

That topless one of Bertie in Morocco, oh it's creepy! 

#### LYDIA

That was three years ago. How much did they scroll through?! 

#### ALEX

And moving on, so you currently have a dog at heel. I'll leave it to you to decide what to do with it. 

#### JAMES

Well I'm going to take him with me. I'm not assuming that he's going to have any skills at this point because he's an ill-disciplined guard dog from like, some mongrel bull mastiff. 

#### ALEX

It looks like someone was trying for a bull mastiff. 

#### BEN

They had a good stab at it. 

#### LYDIA

Stab? 

#### JAMES

He looks like he's a bit of a mess really. Yeah. 

#### LYDIA

Is he drooling everywhere? 

#### ALEX

I'd say he was like half bull mastiff, half Doberman and half postman's leg. (laughter) 

#### JAMES

Right. I get the impression that's sort of like, he's drooling all the time just because that's how his face is. 

#### LYDIA

(cross talking) Eels are sliding out from between his teeth. 

#### ALEX

He also finds it slightly hard to breathe because his nose is a bit messed up, it's like [snorting noise]. 

#### JAMES

But from injury not from like in-breeding or anything? 

#### ALEX

Yeah. 

#### JAMES

I think I take pity on this dog because he's clearly not very bright. I see a lot of myself in him. So, this one, he's not going to have any skills or anything like that but...I want to take him with us but I feel that he would be an encumbrance in a combat situation so I might... 

#### LYDIA

Put a lead on him. 

#### JAMES

Yeah, can I make a lead for him? I've got adventurers kit which has got rope in it. 

#### ALEX

Yeah, so you've used at least one length of rope to tie up both of the guys. 

#### JAMES

I have an adventures kit so... 

#### ALEX

Yeah so you've got more than enough rope. 

#### JAMES

Yeah so I... 

#### LYDIA

Do you need any locksmith's tools for doing that? (laughter) 

#### JAMES

So yeah I make him a little lead and I inspect him to see if he has...I presume he won't have a collar with his name on it will he? The other two are unconscious. 

#### ALEX

He does have a collar and on the collar is... 

#### LYDIA

Is it a spikey one, is it a spikey one?! 

#### ALEX

...on, on the collar is written "Brutor" in like chalk. It's just been chalked on. 

#### LYDIA

How big is this chalk board?! 

#### ALEX

Well someone's had this chalk and just carefully written the word "Brutor" on its collar. 

#### BEN

That sounds like a seventh generation Pokémon! (laughter) 

#### ALEX

There's no...someone looks like that've put like rubbishy studs on it. Not actually studded it, they've got some chunks of metal and just tied them off against it to give him the semblance of a big, scary collar. 

#### JAMES

Right, I'm going to take its collar off. It's very last season. 

#### ALEX

He licks your face or at least tries to as he does it. 

#### JAMES

Oh! Buba, buba! I've got my helmet up at this point, if my helmet's down. He tries to lick my face, I pull my helmet up. 

#### ALEX

He does lick your face and then proceeds to go a bit weird because of all the polish on your eyes. (laughing) 

#### JAMES

It's an acquired taste. I think at that point I've got some of my lovely brandy and I'm going to pour it into my hand and just feed him the brandy. 

#### LYDIA

Aww 

#### BEN

Bonding with a dog. 

#### JAMES

Getting him hammered. 

#### BEN

So we're taking it in yeah? 

#### LYDIA

Yeah 

#### BEN

We ready? We got... 

#### LYDIA

I'm guessing that we did find the key? I searched the bodies. 

#### ALEX

Sorry, yeah, yeah. 

#### LYDIA

Right 1x key. 

#### BEN

What tool...actually did you make it obvious that you had the tanglefoot bag stuff in the end or did you not? 

#### LYDIA

No 

#### BEN

Right so what tools have we got now? So we've... 

#### BRYN

We know there might be traps. 

#### BEN

We're now stocked up on health potions so we're pretty good for that. There's going to be traps which I think is your department definitely. 

#### LYDIA

I've got that. 

#### BRYN

We know that there's only three people inside but one of them might be quite dangerous. 

#### BEN

And it's a magician, he's magic. They have more oil flasks. We can lob an oil flask through the window, we might just burn them... 

#### BRYN

Do we have like, anything that can disorientate them or... 

#### BEN

Do we have another thunder stone? 

#### LYDIA

I've got one. I've got a thunder stone. 

#### BRYN

If we could throw one through the window, that could be effective. 

#### JAMES

Just a thought chaps, if the building's on stilts who's to say that it has to stay on stilts. 

#### BEN

True. 

#### ALEX

Just to jump in, the building that Sasha saw with the lights on was one of the actual still standing stone buildings where they're just on the first floor. There was a shed which was on stilts which appeared to have been made later out of some manky looking wood but the actually building that she saw the lights on was the proper... 

#### JAMES

Proper brick stone building ok. 

#### BRYN

I like the idea that we're just going through and Bertie's like, "yup, knocks down the shed and is like yes! I like it!" (laughing) 

#### LYDIA

Well, I could try and climb up and thrown the thunderstone through. 

#### BEN

The only thing is we won't be able to get there in time because we'll also have to get through all the traps. I think a stealthy approach. When we find the room they're in, throw it through the door. 

#### LYDIA

Gotcha. 

#### BRYN

Ok, that sounds like a good plan. 

#### BEN

And then we can rush them before they can get any silly stuff on. 

#### LYDIA

Ok before going into a full-frontal assault or whatever it was, stealthy one. I want to top up my 2 hit points that I'm still...I think I might. I can either drink a potion or getting a spell. 

#### BRYN

Two zero level spells would be quite efficient and not that useful in other situations. 

#### BEN

Yeah, I'll just... 

#### LYDIA

I've got still a bit of stabbing left from that last...do you need your spells or? 

#### BEN

No, it should be alright. I'm just considering which ones to get rid of because I've got detect position...I think it's stabilise or correct water. I think my heal check is good enough to not have to worry. 

#### LYDIA

There's a ton of water around. 

#### BEN

But if the building's on fire I can't get the Thames out. I'm now paranoid about fire because of Alex's inferno encounter. So, I will get rid of...I will burn the detect position of stabilise. 

#### LYDIA

Back on 10. 

#### ALEX

I'm going to poison all of you and no one's going to be stable! [evil laugh] 

#### BRYN

So like technically characters don't know about hit points. 

#### LYDIA

Right, I've got some wounds basically. 

#### BRYN

But a cleric with a heal check can assess like how badly hurt you are and that's the sort of the workaround for it. 

#### BEN

Would you like me to do an assessment? 

#### ALEX

Honestly I'd rather accelerate the game because your heal's that high it's kind of immaterial. I would just say something like if you ever need a heal rather than saying, "I need 2 heal" just go up and say I feel dodgy and then he'll just effectively know. 

#### LYDIA

Gotcha. 

#### ALEX

I mean unless you have something quite obscure, in which case, like if you were say you were poisoned with a hallucinogen or something, I mean obviously I wouldn't get you to go I have some kind of hallucinogen in me 

#### JAMES

Cleric, cleric, it hurts when I touch my arm, it hurts when I touch my leg, it hurts when I touch my nose... (speaking over each other) 

#### ALEX

That's because you're a zombie! 

#### LYDIA

Your hand's broken! 

#### JAMES

That's cause your finger's broken, yeah! (laughing) 

#### BRYN

That's because you've had Malekith's Eternal Pain cast upon you! 

#### ALEX

Welcome to a brave new world! 

#### BEN

Pathfinder GPs. 

#### ALEX

You know what. I think I'm going to call it there and you guys know what you are going to do, you've got a plan. You know what you're going to do. You're going to sweep in... 

#### LYDIA

I'm going to stab so many people! 

#### BRYN

Now you mentioned earlier, I don't know if you mentioned it on recording but you said that overnight while we slept last night, we all levelled up. 

#### ALEX

Yes, that is true. 

#### BRYN

So, also we're going to also before our next actual live session, where we record the next few episodes, we're all going to have to level up our characters and be level two! (cheering) 

#### ALEX

That's insane! Yeah so, we'll get back on that one and we'll definitely spend a bit of time at the start of the next episode discussing it. So, I'll tell you what Bryn, use your announcer voice to send us off. 

#### BRYN

(announcer voice) Tune in next week for more exciting tales from Rusty Quill Gaming! (cheering)

##### [new clip fades in]



#### ALEX

... and we're coming to you from London, England and playing in London, England. Now I think about it, I never realised... 

#### ALL OTHER PLAYERS

Woooaaahhh! 

#### JAMES

How deep does this rabbit hole go?! 

#### BEN

Maybe, maybe the game isn't the game, maybe we are the game... 

#### JAMES

Maybe we're the players in the game, we're being played by like, there's a paladin and a cleric and we're all sat around a table in a castle somewhere and we're playing this real-life game... 

#### BRYN

Stop. No re-cursing. (groans and laughter) 

#### ALEX

Take the red pill and you'll find yourself at a table and it's really sweaty....
