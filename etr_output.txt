##### [Music]

1. INT. OIAR BREAKROOM -- NIGHT, CLEAR. (CCTV) CELIA is having a moment to herself with a strong coffee. ALICE enters. 

#### ALICE

How's the new blend? 

#### CELIA

Vicious. 

#### ALICE

Excellent. ALICE pours herself a cup, then opens a cabinet, reaches up and pulls down a pack of biscuits. She carefully extracts two, replaces the pack, closes the cabinet then sits next to CELIA. 

#### ALICE

Choco Leibnitz? 

#### CELIA

Ooh, the good stuff! I'm honoured. 

#### ALICE

Damn right you are. They eat. Beat. ALICE (CONT.) So. How's tricks? 

#### CELIA

(yawning) Not bad. You? 

#### ALICE

Same old. Been anywhere good recently? 

#### CELIA

Oh well, y'know. 

#### ALICE

Do I? Beat. She eats again. 

#### ALICE CONT.

Oh, the date! Yeah! I was going to ask you about that, actually. 

#### CELIA

Oh yeah? 

#### ALICE

So... how was it? 

#### CELIA

It was... good. 

#### ALICE

Ah. 

#### CELIA

No, no it was good it's just... well... 

#### ALICE

Just...? 

#### CELIA

We mostly talked about work. 

#### ALICE

(pitying) Oh Sam. 

#### CELIA

You know what he's like, he's a sweet guy but he can just be a bit... 

#### ALICE

Infuriating? 

#### CELIA

(laughing) -intense sometimes. 

#### ALICE

Yeah. What were you actually talking about? He's been kinda worked up about the job ever since you two went out. It's like watching a dog with a toffee -- funny at first, but it's hard not to worry... 

#### CELIA

(smiling) We were just speculating on what the actual deal is. You know, the big 'why'. 

#### ALICE

Sure, I went through the same thing when I started. 

#### CELIA

I mean, it wasn't all work. 

#### ALICE

Let me guess, discount roses, twofor-one sushi and a split cab home before nine, that sort of thing? 

#### CELIA

I'm more of a lilies gal. 

#### ALICE

(smiling) A woman after my own heart. Well don't be too hard on him. He tries his best, he's just a bit... naff sometimes. 

#### CELIA

I'm sure he'll do better next time. 

#### ALICE

Ha! Yeah. (realising she's serious) Oh! Cool. Beat. They finish their biscuits. 

#### CELIA

Listen Alice[5] 

#### ALICE

(sighing) Here we go... 

#### CELIA

Is this going to be a problem? 

#### ALICE

Golly gosh I hope not! 

#### CELIA

I'm serious. you need to tell me if you're going to have an issue with us. I don't know what the deal was between you, but I'm not interested in getting tangled up in workplace drama. 

#### ALICE

(dripping with sarcasm) The only drama is the dilemma of how I could possibly get by without you all to myself! Beat. 

#### CELIA

(uncertain) Alice, I... 

#### ALICE

...am too intimidated by your genius intellect and desperately hot bod and think we should just stay friends? I couldn't agree more. She stands to leave. 

#### ALICE CONT.

And on that note I'm going to head off before I make you any more in love with me. Just try to restrain yourself yeah? Sam's masculinity is already hanging by a thread. 

#### CELIA

(mustering a laugh) Sure. ALICE exits. CELIA blows through her cheeks a bit overwhelmed. 2. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE, NIGHT, CLEAR (CCTV) SAM is working at the computer slowly but steadily. LENA approaches. 

#### LENA

Good evening, Sam. How are you getting on? 

#### SAM

Oh, er, Yeah, good, great thank you. Getting into the groove. 

#### LENA

I'm glad to hear it. Beat. 

#### SAM

Was there... something else? 

#### LENA

Have you seen Gwen tonight? 

#### SAM

I've not I'm afraid. But if I do, I'll send her your way. 

#### LENA

See that you do. Thank you, Sam. 

#### SAM

Sure. Beat. LENA heads off. 

#### SAM

Okay... Sam gets back to work and triggers another case.

#### CHESTER

Treatment Report. Elima Pest Ltd. Attending Technician: Alyssa Beck Date: 01.08.1995. Job No. 8146 Client Contact: Anthony Walker. Property Type: Commercial. Address: Resounding Reptile Emporium, Hartshill, NewcastleUnder-Lyme Follow up Required: Yes Report Type: Call Out Note: Follow up postponed until location of attending technician determined. Initial Assessment -- 15:30 Call out received from dispatch at 15:05 to attend the property. Client reported that a rat had been spotted in the shop's break room. Upon arrival I met with the proprietor. Shopkeeper was concerned about the potential of fleas or ticks brought in by the rodent. He had clear red/sore patches around his neck from itching. I assured him that unless he had come into close contact, it was unlikely that he had been bitten or suffered from parasite transference. Most likely psychosomatic phantom bites as an effect of the current heatwave. Worth noting however, that the strong odour of the shop indicates that the IAQ of the Reptile Emporium is likely below recommendations. Follow-up probably required. I suspect that due to the heat and humidity of the shop, mosquitoes may be present, which might also be the source of the shopkeeper's skin irritation. The Resounding Reptile Emporium backs onto a marshy nature reserve, which increases this risk, although none spotted during initial inspection. Requested shop to be cleared of customers for full inspection. Client's agitation increased, presumably due business worries, resulting in a brief altercation. Kept mentioning "his burden" and grabbing at my sleeve. Received slight scratch by accident, but no escalation or violence, so no need for a full incident report, although anyone following up should be advised there may be a mental health problem. Inspection -- 15:41 Break room situated in an annex separated from the main shop by a formerly external door (adequate barrier between main shop and affected area). Customers vacated from premises by client. Multiple uncovered food sources present in break room:  open bin containing various unfinished food items and empty frozen mice packets (snake food, presumably).  Discarded crisp and sweet wrappers on countertops. Even with window open, there is a strong smell of spoiled food. Recommended consideration: sealed waste disposal and food storage. Ants spotted in and around cabinets, follow-up required for treatment if full infestation identified. Further Inspection -- 15:50 Found Cylindrical droppings with sheared ends, indicating squirrel. Minimal volume: likely just the one. Woodland area and trees directly outside breakroom window. Recommended prevention: mesh grate over window to prevent further ingress. Squirrel discovered on overhead cabinets. Window left fully opened to aid exit. Area sealed. Treatment -- 16:10 Retrieved live capture trap from van. Customers granted re-entry to shop floor. During room preparation small hole discovered between wall of breakroom and adjacent room. Used by squirrel as point of egress. Adjacent room locked, key requested and signed out with client. Hole sealed. Summary -- 16:30 Squirrel found among storage boxes and captured alive with trap. Will seal ingress hole after removal. Captured squirrel appears lethargic, likely injured or poisoned.

#### ******

Police aren't here yet. They say any minute but I don't think it'll matter. I can still hear the operator on the phone, but it's just noise. Snakes, thousands of them. How could he keep so many in there? Dad, this is for you. For everything you taught me, everything you shared. I need you to know what happened and I know you'll believe me.. Don't blame yourself for not answering the phone. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. The other room, the one the squirrel escaped to, the one I'm in now, it's a sort of makeshift CCTV office. Just a storage closet, really. All the cameras show the shop interior. Just after I caught the damn thing, when I was about to head out, something caught my eye. On the screen. I wasn't being nosy, I promise, it was just there. I couldn't help but notice. The client, the guy who owns the shop, he was reaching over the counter, grabbing at a customer, while their daughter stood crying nearby. I recognised the girl, or at least the toy gosling she was holding, remembered how she looked at her Dad when I told the two of them to wait outside. It reminded me of us. It's selfish how I wish you were here now dad. When I unsealed the shop floor the shopkeeper seemed obsessed with continuing his sales pitch to the pair. He was adamant that they purchase a snake, and pretty much ignored me entirely. It made me a bit uneasy, so I hung back to watch. Thinking back... I should have noticed he was off. As I watched the monitor the shopkeeper suddenly lunged forward, clearing the desk, smashing the glass on his way with a crash I heard even through the closed door, leaving him sprawling among the crickets previously boxed on the shelf behind him. They were jumping, flowing, twitching. Thousands of them, just juddering pixels on the monitor, but the noise was palpable, punching through the wall like a fist. I grabbed my phone and called the police. I should've gone out there and helped but- but I was scared. I just couldn't. I started to explain over the phone and they said something back but I wasn't listening. On the screen I could see the customer had scrambled to his feet and he and his daughter were nearly out of the entrance. The shopkeeper lunged one last time and that's when I noticed he'd... started to change. He was bloated. Swollen around the neck. The door slammed in his face and as he stumbled backwards something fell from his mouth. I couldn't make it out though. The screen was so fuzzy, and it was just a blur. Moments passed with no noise except the screaming crickets and my own thudding heartbeat. The shopkeeper lay completely prone, he hadn't moved at all, and I wondered if the fall had knocked him out, cracked his skull or something. Then there was movement near his head, and he began to twitch and spasm. I thought it might be a seizure but then, his mouth began to open, wider and wider, impossibly wide, his jaw bones snapping with the strain. And then a horde of slender shapes slithered out. Snakes, Dad. Thousands of them. All from inside him, pushing up through his deflating throat. The floor was lost beneath the heaving, writhing mass of them. I could hear the scrape of their scales on the linoleum, but they made no other sound. Then the owner's body began to slide across the floor towards the closed door between us. It took me a moment to realise his body was being pulled over the broken glass and debris, carried on the creatures' backs. Towards me. I got the door locked just in time. This room, it's a mess. Printouts, delivery notes, a bunch of rejection letters from some institute he pinned to the wall with a kitchen knife. And it's hot in here, dad. Too hot. Oh god. I can feel it. My throat is swelling. And it itches. I can still hear all the snakes brushing up against the door and... in the walls, I think. Christ, they're in the walls... Oh god. I forgot about the hole. I love you Da- 4. INT. OIAR OFFICE. NIGHT. CLEAR (COMPUTER) The case ends and Sam sits quietly viewing the monitor. Sam exhales slowly having unknowingly been holding his breath. Beat. 

#### SAM

(quietly) No. No. Could be any institute. 

#### GWEN

The letters, you mean? 

#### SAM

Jesus! Don't sneak up on people like that! 

#### GWEN

(putting bags down) I didn't "sneak up". It's not my fault if you're distracted. 

#### SAM

When did you get here? 

#### GWEN

Just now. Seems pretty straightforward to me. Snakes, not sure what the collective noun is, horde maybe? Cross link with infection too probably. I wouldn't have thought the letters have any bearing on the classification. 

#### SAM

Uh, right. Yeah. Thanks. 

#### GWEN

You can check the binder yourself though, I've got other stuff to do. 

#### SAM

Yeah. Oh, hey, speaking of, Lena was after you. 

#### GWEN

When? 

#### SAM

Dunno. Few minutes ago. She seemed uh... not happy. 

#### GWEN

Is she ever? 

#### SAM

Hah. 

#### GWEN

What did you tell her? 

#### SAM

Hmmm? Nothing. Just that I hadn't seen you. Something wrong? 

#### GWEN

Nothing you can help with. Beat. 

#### SAM

Listen, GwenGWEN Just leave it alright. Focus on your cases. You wouldn't understand. 

#### SAM

(cold) Of course not. 

#### GWEN

That's not(heading off) I don't have time for this. GWEN exits. 

#### SAM

(muttering to himself) No-one ever does. The recording cuts off.
