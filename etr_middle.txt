#### ICS, TOILETS -- MORNING
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
(Distressed) Monsters! They're all monsters!
##### [SHUHELA SOFTLY SHUSHES, TRYING TO CALM HIM DOWN]
#### SHUHELA
It's alright...
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
I just- And then- then with the teeth... Ah, the teeth!
##### [HAROLD WHIMPERS/SOBS]
#### SHUHELA
I, I know love, I know. It's a lot to process.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES; FOOTSTEPS]
#### FRANK
Shuhela? What's-
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
Mum dying is a lot to process. People trying to rip me off, that's a lot to
process. But this? This is-
#### SHUHELA
I-I-It's okay, Frank. We're just having a little bit of a wobble, aren't we Harold?
##### [KNOCKING ON CUBICLE DOOR]
##### [HAROLD WHIMPERS]
#### FRANK
He's locked himself in the bogs?
#### SHUHELA
Yeah...
#### FRANK
Why?
#### SHUHELA
It's my fault. He's been so interested in everything, I thought it might be good
if he met Len and some of the others before their session.
#### FRANK
(Wearily) Ah... Shuhela...
#### SHUHELA
He said he was ready!
#### FRANK
Ah, and you believed him?
#### SHUHELA
(to Harold) Just open the door, eh, love? Open the door and we can sit down,
and have a nice cuppa, and talk it out, yeah?
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
No!
I'm never coming out!
#### FRANK
What happened?
#### SHUHELA
Well...
##### [FLASHBACK TRANSITION]
#### ICS, MEETING ROOM -- EARLIER
#### SHUHELA
So, before you all get started, I just wanted to introduce everyone to... Harold.
VAMPIRES (UNISON)
(Disinterestedly) Hi, Harold.
#### HAROLD
Hello.
#### SHUHELA
And so we thought it might be a good idea for him to start meeting some more
of the gang. Maybe sit in on the, uh, start of today's open, if everyone is okay
with that?
##### [THE VAMPIRES MURMUR NONCOMITTALLY BUT BROADLY AMENABLE]
#### HAROLD
Great.
##### [CHAIRS SCRAPE]
#### SHUHELA
Ooh, thanks everyone. I'll just stick around for a bit and make sure everyone's
settled in.
#### HAROLD
You'll hardly know I'm here.
#### SHUHELA
Great, so-
#### HAROLD
(Joking) Because I'm a ghost.
#### ...
What?
#### SHUHELA
So, Len, why don't you take it from here?
(Aside, to Harold) Len is the vampire support group rep. They've been talking
about issues around anonymity, really deep stuff.
#### HAROLD
Of course they have.
#### LEN
Right then. First, I'd like to welcome everyone to today's session. It's, uh, it's
good to see some new faces, vamps, friends and family and that and, uh...
Harold obviously.
Well, anyway, who'd like to start?
#### ...
Cheers Suzy.
#### SUZY
Hey. Yeah, so, um, I don't want to speak for everyone. We've all got our own
personal journeys and that, but I'm just... tired of people not even
acknowledging that I'm there. Like, I know this only works if we all keep a low
profile, loved ones too, anonymous solidarity and all that. But these days, lying
low feels like way more than just staying out of trouble. I might as well be
literally invisible, you know?
##### [MURMURED ASSENT FROM THE VAMPIRES]
#### HAROLD
Hmm. Yeah, yeah, like with chuggers.
#### LEN
What's that, Harold?
#### HAROLD
Chuggers. You know, 'charity muggers?' Those hippies that stand on corners
and get all up in your grill about sea turtles or other stuff. It's a total scam. I
mean they're all on commission, you know. Whenever I see one coming I just
cross the road, fake a phone call or something.
#### SUZY
(Bemused) Yeah... Right, um...
#### SHUHELA
Uh, th-thank you for that Harold, but, um, let's try not to interrupt in the
future, alright love?
#### HAROLD
If you say so.
#### LEN
You were saying, Suzy?
#### SUZY
Er, no. No, it's fine. I was basically finished anyway.
#### LEN
If you're sure.
##### [PAPER RUSTLING]
So, Robbie, you mentioned something interesting last time that I thought we
could return to. All about accepting differences before we can manage them.
Do you want to speak on that a bit more?
#### ROBBIE
I mean, yeah, basically, it's just, like, we don't just have to stay dry, we have to
fake being normal, and look all 'together' on top, y'know?
And it's like, you've got to cut yourself some slack cos it's hard enough without
beating yourself up about always being perfect, y'know?
##### [MORE MURMURED ASSENT]
I don't know... it's like, I'm already using all my energy not to just fall back and
get fucking wasted, never mind all the extra stuff.
#### HAROLD
Mmm, yeah. I totally know where you're coming from.
#### LEN
Harold, I realise that you're trying to be helpful and relate, but I really think
you might want to just listen for this session, alright?
#### SHUHELA
Yes, Harold love, let's not-
#### HAROLD
No, no, no, honestly, I-I've been there. Okay. We all have had those days
where you just want to cut loose, and you get carried away, and the next day
you remember everything you did, and you're like, 'Gargh!' Oh, and the
hangovers, am I right?
#### ROBBIE
Is this a joke to you mate?
#### LEN
Okay. Why don't we all just take a moment and-
#### ROBBIE
I was nicking offcuts from the butchers just to get by, and you sit there
pretending like you have any idea-
#### HAROLD
No, no, hey, I-I'm just saying that, that a bit of willpower and you can just
overcome-
##### [ROBBIE HISSES, LEAPING FOR HAROLD, KNOCKING CHAIRS OVER]
##### [SUZY INTERCEPTS AND STRUGGLES WITH ROBBIE]
#### SUZY
It's alright, Robbie!
#### SHUHELA
Okay, Harold, time to go!
#### SUZY
Leave him!
#### HAROLD
What's wrong with his eyes?
Oh god! His teeth!
##### [ROBBIE CONTINUES TO SNARL WHILE STRUGGLING AGAINST RESTRAINT]
#### LEN
(Calmingly) Come on, Robbie, you've been making proper progress. Don't let
some stupid arsehole ruin it, alright?
Just focus on the breathing, yeah? In...
#### SUZY
(Struggling) He's just ignorant! It, it isn't worth it!
#### LEN
... and out...
#### ROBBIE
(Panting) He needs... to learn...
#### SUZY
That's right! You're bang on, look, he does, yes-
#### LEN
... and in...
#### SUZY
Yeah. But this isn't how we show them they're wrong, is it, Robbie?
Come on. Come on now, you've got this.
#### LEN
... and out...
##### [ROBBIE'S BREATHING EVENS OUT, WITH A SNARL HE RESUMES HIS SEAT]
#### SHUHELA
Okay, right, well, thank you Len. Good job everyone! Woo.
I'll just, uh, I'll help Harold up and take him for some fresh air. You all carry
on...
##### [FLASH FORWARD TO]
#### ICS, TOILETS -- MORNING
#### FRANK
What were you expecting?
#### SHUHELA
I had no idea he thought we were messing with him!
#### FRANK
He hasn't believed any of it. He thought we were scammers.
#### SHUHELA
(Indignant) Who? Me and you? And Cressida?
#### FRANK
Mmmhmm.
#### SHUHELA
(Realising) Nooooo... But- but how? I mean, he's seen all the-
Oh dear, I didn't realise... Oh, okay...
#### FRANK
(Calling) Harold! It's Frank.
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
You stay out!
#### FRANK
Harold, you can't just hide in the bog all day.
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
Yes I can!
#### FRANK
Fine! You stay here. Enjoy the smell.
#### SHUHELA
We can't just leave him!
#### FRANK
(Exaggeratedly) You heard him, we should just leave him here.
#### SHUHELA
Frank!
#### FRANK
(Exaggeratedly) Completely alone.
##### [CUBICLE UNLOCKS, FOOTSTEPS]
#### SHUHELA
(Gently) Ohhh, hello, love.
#### HAROLD
(Shaken) He tried to bite me.
#### SHUHELA
But he didn't. Did he?
#### FRANK
You got him riled up. It's just his natural response to a threat.
#### HAROLD
“Natural”?! There was nothing “natural” about him!
#### FRANK
If you'd taken him seriously to begin with, he wouldn't have come at you like
that. He's pretty young, and you pushed his buttons.
#### HAROLD
Oh, so it's my fault he nearly tore my throat out, is it?
#### FRANK
Pretty much.
#### SHUHELA
No, love, if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. I should have explained all this to you
before we went in there.
#### HAROLD
You can't let a thing like that walk the streets! It'll kill someone!
#### SHUHELA
(Stern) They're not “things” Harold! They're still people, just like you. They just
have a condition.
#### HAROLD
They're not the same as us! Shuhela, they're not the same at all!
#### FRANK
No, you're right. Because at least we get to live in a world that accepts we
even exist.
#### SHUHELA
Our job is to help them keep their lives together. That's what your Mum spent
her whole life trying to do!
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### SUZY
(Cautiously) How are we doing in here?
Ooohh, that is a smell.
##### [HAROLD SHRIEKS AND SHUTS HIMSELF IN CUBICLE AGAIN]
Oh. I see.
#### SHUHELA
Ah, he-he'll be alright.
##### [FRANK SNORTS]
#### SUZY
Sure. May I?
##### [FOOTSTEPS AND GENTLE DOOR KNOCKING]
(calling) Harold? Harold, its Suzy.
##### [HAROLD WHIMPERS]
Robbie asked me to come in and apologise for him since you probably don't
want to see him right now. He shouldn't have reacted like that, okay? He was
out of order, and, and he's sorry. He's working on it.
#### ...
Anyway, I just wanted to check in and let you know. If you ever have any
questions about this... stuff or whatever, I'm around.
HAROLD (MUFFLED)
(Meekly) Yeah.
##### [HAROLD COUGHS, THEN IN DEEPER VOICE]
Yeah, okay.
#### SUZY
(Surprised) Uh. Oh. Uh... alright, good. Well... I'll leave you to it then. Look after
yourself, Harold.
##### [FOOTSTEPS BACKING OFF]
#### SHUHELA
You were an absolute star out there, my love. You should be proud.
#### FRANK
Well done.
#### SUZY
(Awkward at praise) I, uh, right, yes. Uh, anyway, I'll, I'll come round later if it's
still okay for me to borrow that charger?
#### SHUHELA
Of course, love. You know where to find me.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### SHUHELA
(Calling) She's gone now, love.
##### [HAROLD EMERGES]
#### HAROLD
(Shaky) I just. I thought all this was, y'know, like a scam and, and-
#### FRANK
No, it's not.
#### HAROLD
No.
#### SHUHELA
No.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### CRESSIDA
Here you all are. What on earth are you doing huddling in here? I- Goodness
Harold, are you alright?
#### HAROLD
Yeah. Uh... I'm fine. Everything is fine.
#### SHUHELA
Just a bit of a wobble, nothing to worry about.
#### CRESSIDA
A... “wobble”?
#### HAROLD
I do not “wobble”! I'm fine! Can we just... move on, please?
#### CRESSIDA
Certainly. I have news: we've finally got a date for the acquisition meeting. The
council contacted me this morning. They wanted to see us this Friday, 10am
sharp.
#### SHUHELA
Ooh, fantastic!
#### HAROLD
Acquisition of what?
#### CRESSIDA
We are going to make a pitch for why we should officially acquire St Mark's
Church. Friday at 10am, we tell the council why we are better suited to owning
St Mark's and its grounds than anyone else. As you can clearly see, and, uh,
##### [SNIFFS] smell... this building is not exactly in the best repair, and we are
running out of room for all the... services we provide. So, a change of location
is needed.
#### SHUHELA
So what about Iris's speech? She wrote pages and pages about the whole
shebang.
#### CRESSIDA
Well, I had thought Harold might want to do that.
#### HAROLD
Me?
#### FRANK
Him?
#### CRESSIDA
Yes. This could be Harold's chance to begin representing ICS as its new co-CEO,
to tell the people in power that we're the only ones with a practical solution to
the inexplicables left on the streets, and that we need a larger premises to
enact it. What do you think?
#### HAROLD
Oh. Well, uh, naturally, I'm flattered, but... I'm not sure I'm the one to- I know
nothing about the project, I don't even know what-
#### SHUHELA
We can talk you through it! We've got four whole days and all of Iris's notes.
It'll be a fantastic chance for you to build some bridges!
#### HAROLD
Oh, I don't know...
#### FRANK
It'll keep you safe in the office for a while.
#### HAROLD
Oh. Well. I mean, I'll do it if it needs to be done but-
#### CRESSIDA
Excellent.
#### SHUHELA
Oh, I'm sure you'll be brilliant, love.
#### FRANK
Mmmm.
#### IRIS' HOUSE -- MORNING
##### [CLOCK TICKING, THEN STARTS CHIMING]
#### MEREDITH
Oh, for fuck's sake.
##### [MEREDITH SIGHS, PULLS OUT PHONE AND DIALS; RINGTONE THEN...]
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Hello?
#### MEREDITH
Hello handsome! Have you had an accident in the last three months because of
some dipshit back seat driver?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Who is this?
#### MEREDITH
Oh shit, uh... Sorry, wrong number.
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Meredith?
#### MEREDITH
Wait. Godbolt?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Oh, hey! I didn't realise. Uh, how did you get my number?
DENISE (TELEPHONE, DISTANT)
He just needs a little more backbone.
#### MEREDITH
Oh, you know me, international lady of mystery and all that.
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
(Aside) Shhh now, just a minute.
(To Meredith) Uh, what did you say, sorry?
#### MEREDITH
I said I'm an international- Forget it, it's not funny.
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Alright.
#### MEREDITH
So... who was that on the phone?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Oh that's, uh... that's no-one. What's up?
#### MEREDITH
Well, I... just checked my diary and apparently my very important call with the
Hong Kong investors was just rescheduled by one of my PAs, meaning I have a
free afternoon.
Maybe you fancy a cheeky catch-up? Drinks? Me actually staying conscious this
time?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Oh, uh... well...
DENISE (TELEPHONE, DISTANT)
He was the same at school. Never spoke to anyone.
#### MEREDITH
Oh. You with someone?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
What? No.
(Aside) Shh, please, I-I'll be there in a minute.
DENISE (TELEPHONE, DISTANT)
Saw doctor after doctor. Fat lot of good it did.
#### MEREDITH
Is... Is, is everything all right?
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Hmm? What? Oh yeah, everything's great.
#### MEREDITH
I mean, hey, if you're with someone then it's not a big deal, I'll just-
DENISE (TELEPHONE, DISTANT)
Is that Nick? Say hi to him! Hiiii baby boy!
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
No I'm- H-Hang on, I'll, I'll just go outside.
#### MEREDITH
Actually, you know what? It's fine.
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
No! Wait just let me explain.
#### MEREDITH
I said it's fine.
GODBOLT (TELEPHONE)
Meredith...
#### MEREDITH
Say 'Hi' to Nick for me.
##### [PHONE BEEPS AS CUT OFF]
#### MEREDITH
Urgh. Stupid. Stupid, fucking stupid! You never call them back!

Ohhh... damn it!

CALI-BIGMAN (VIDEO)
Wwwwhat is up my dudes! This is Cali-Bigman, and today we're gonna be
looking at my personally approved Top Ten List for absolute public speaking
domination! As always though, before we start make sure to smash that Like
button, smash the Subscribe button and ring-a-ling that bell for all of my latest
self-improvement vids!
Now, let's get straight into it!
Now, research has shown that the fear of public speaking ranks even higher
than the fear of spiders, even higher than the fear of heights and, get this,
even higher than the fear of death! So it's not surprising that a whole bunch of
you have commented asking for my help-
##### [HAROLD'S PHONE RINGS; VIDEO PAUSES WITH A CLICK]
##### [HAROLD TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND EXHALES, BEFORE ANSWERING]
#### HAROLD
Harold Stonewell.
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
Harold, its John Belfrage.
#### HAROLD
John, hi, yeah, I've been meaning to call you back.
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
Are you available this Monday at 9 o'clock?
#### HAROLD
Oh, um, I'm not sure, I haven't got my diary in front of me... Can you remind
me what it's regarding?
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
I've spoken to Rajshree. We need you to come to Endeavour Square so you
have a chance to put your side across to the investigation.
#### HAROLD
Investigation? [SNORTS] I'm not sure what exactly you think is going here,
but-
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
I think we're looking at multiple instances of gross misconduct, including
misappropriation of client funds, negligent investment into a fraudulent real
estate scam, illegal international transfers-
#### HAROLD
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, hang on just a minute!
(Adopts sad tone) As I've already explained, I recently lost my mother, and I'm
really not in a fit emotional state to engage in this sort of conjecture-
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
Yes, you said. Except your “emotional state” hasn't stopped you from taking
over her business, has it?
#### HAROLD
I'm sorry?
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
I have been reliably informed that you're now CEO for her business in...
Gravesby. That is correct, isn't it?
#### HAROLD
What!? No! No! Well... I'm acting purely in an advisory capacity, you see, I'm
not drawing a wage, and I wouldn't-
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
I hope I don't need to remind you that taking such a position whilst under
investigation would violate all kinds of protocols.
#### HAROLD
Absolutely, I'd never dream of-
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
I think you should probably speak to your Legal Officer then. Because not only
is she under the impression you're now Acting CEO of your mother's company,
but she also seems to think you are making withdrawals from said company.
#### HAROLD
What!? Jesus Christ! No, John, I did not instruct anyone to do anything like
that!
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
Listen Harold, let's be honest with each other. You've mucked us around for
long enough-
#### HAROLD
(Indignant) Mucked you around! John, my mother died!
I had a funeral to organise, the transition of a business to oversee, and I've got
a three-bedroom house to sell. I haven't had the time, frankly, to-
BELFRAGE (TELEPHONE)
Be here on Monday morning at 9am. Otherwise we're looking at an arrest.
##### [BEEP AS BELFRAGE HANGS UP]
#### HAROLD
Shit.
(Softly) Fucking...

Meredith?

(Pained) I think something just entered me.
#### MEREDITH
Hot.
#### GODBOLT
Look, Meredith...
#### MEREDITH
It's fine, alright, none of my business who you're shagging.
#### GODBOLT
Would you shut up for two damn seconds and listen?
#### MEREDITH
One... Two...
#### GODBOLT
That was my Aunt Denise on the phone. She's in a care home and I visit her
when I can, because, well, she's not exactly firing on all cylinders, if you get
me.
#### MEREDITH
Sure, whatever. So who's Nick?
#### GODBOLT
My cousin. Denise's son. Never visits her. Just a useless sack of shit, really.
#### MEREDITH
Right.
So... why did you come all the way here just to say that?
#### GODBOLT
Oh. Well... I thought, well... I, I dunno, I, I thought you might be-
#### MEREDITH
What? Jealous? Don't flatter yourself, you're not all that.
#### GODBOLT
(Cocky) Oh yeah?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah. You're like, a 4. 5, tops. I've had much better offers.
#### GODBOLT
Ouch.
#### MEREDITH
Yeah.
##### [LEAVES RUSTLE AS GODBOLT STRUGGLES WITH BUSH]

No, I mean literally, ouch. This bush is really getting, ah... kinda, ah, intimate.
Can you help me up please?

I really am a fucking saint you know that, right?
##### [MORE RUSTLING AS MEREDITH ASSISTS]

Ow, ow, dammit. [SIGHS]
Who has roses by their front door? Oh fuck, these are my best jeans!

Oh yeah, laugh it up.

Look, just get inside before you moon some poor granny or something.

Could you at least have some... wine? It's a bit less suspicious than just sitting
there with an empty plate, watching me eat.
#### LILY
Water's fine. Look, Cressida, I've got a call in thirty minutes, so-
#### CRESSIDA
Very well. Your little package is under the table.
##### [CRINKLE OF PAPER]
#### LILY
Is it fresh?
#### CRESSIDA
Does it really matter? Now, tell me. How are things looking at your end?
##### [RUSTLING AS PACKAGE IS STOWED]
#### LILY
You've got the council for the entire morning session if you need it.
#### CRESSIDA
Excellent. And is William likely to be gracing us with his presence?
#### LILY
Well, I can't exactly just keep him locked up in his office.
#### CRESSIDA
Sadly not. But he will need you to get him there, won't he?
#### LILY
What are you suggesting?
#### CRESSIDA
I'm suggesting that if he were to be, let's say, unavoidably detained in transit
for the duration of the meeting, that would be very fortuitous for ICS.
#### LILY
Cressida...
##### [BACKGROUND DOOR OPENS/CLOSES; FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]
#### CRESSIDA
It wouldn't need to be anything drastic, just a minor-
Oh...
Harold...
#### LILY
What?
##### [ANGRY FOOTSTEPS]
#### HAROLD
Just what the hell do you think you're playing at?
#### CRESSIDA
Lily, this is Harold Stonewell, Iris's son, and as of yesterday, her successor.
Harold, Lily is William Allen's personal assistant.
#### LILY
We've met.
#### HAROLD
(To Lily) Yes, hello again.
(To Cressida, loudly) Look, I don't know what you think you're playing at, but if
you think for one moment that you can just-
##### [FOOTSTEPS]
#### WAITER
Is everything alright?
#### CRESSIDA
It's lovely, thank you dear.
Harold, do sit down. People are staring at you.
#### WAITER
Would you like a menu, sir?
#### HAROLD
What? No, I'm not-! I'm not staying long.
##### [CHAIR SCRAPES AS HE SITS]
#### WAITER
Can I get you a drink then?
#### HAROLD
No, thank you!
##### [FOOTSTEPS]
#### LILY
I can leave you two if you wan-
#### CRESSIDA
(To Lily) Nonsense. This will only take a moment.
(To Harold) Now Harold, anything you want to say to me, you can say in front
of Lily.
#### HAROLD
I- Really? Fine. You had no business tipping off the FCA.
#### CRESSIDA
Pardon me?
#### HAROLD
John Belfrage! You told him I was taking over the business!
#### CRESSIDA
You'll have to forgive me Harold, but you did suggest I get in contact with him.
#### HAROLD
Yeah, well, I, w- That's beside the point!
#### CRESSIDA
And it's a good job I did. When you and Meredith announced you were taking
over ICS, I had to do some due diligence in my capacity as Acting Legal Officer.
#### HAROLD
Yes, alright, but that doesn't excuse going behind my-
#### CRESSIDA
You can imagine my surprise when I discovered that you were part of an
investigation. And for fraud, no less.
#### HAROLD
It's none of your bloody concern!
#### CRESSIDA
Well, acting as both Legal and Financial Officer for ICS -- an organisation which
you are now the newly appointed co-CEO of -- I'm afraid that it is very much my
concern. With this in mind, I have notified the relevant authorities of your
appointment as director. Furthermore, I am now informing you as your advisor
that we should prepare you for the very real possibility of imminent criminal
charges.
#### HAROLD
But I am as much a victim as any of my clients!
#### CRESSIDA
(Dripping with 'sympathy') Of course you are. And as Legal Officer for ICS, I'm
duty bound to assist you in proving that fact. But I can only do so from a place
of perceived transparency. Do you understand?
#### HAROLD
You- [SIGHS]
Right. Yeah, I get it. Just... run things by me in future, okay? Especially where
the FCA are concerned. Belfrage isn't an idiot.
#### CRESSIDA
Noted. Now, I do need to mention that assisting you in these matters will be
quite a drain on my time. As a result, I will need you to 'step-up' a bit more as
CEO to help maintain the business. We are this close to securing St. Mark's,
and finally being able to provide a real inexplicables shelter, but we can't do it
without your invaluable help.
#### HAROLD
Oh well, yes. O-Of course. Anything I can do.
#### CRESSIDA
Excellent. I'm so pleased we had this talk, Harold. Now, please don't let me
keep you any further.
#### HAROLD
Right, yes. Uh. I need to go finish the speech, and uh... yeah.
##### [CHAIR SCRAPES AS HE STANDS]
Nice meeting you Lily.
#### LILY
Likewise.
##### [FOOTSTEPS DEPART; DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### CRESSIDA
(Smiling) Oh, nervous little weasel, isn't he?
#### LILY
William would eat him alive in a debate.
#### CRESSIDA
Which is why we're going to have to think of something you can do, so that
doesn't happen and our arrangement can continue. Aren't we, my dear?
#### LILY
Apparently.
#### ICS, MAIN OFFICE -- EVENING
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES; FOOTSTEPS, CHAIR RATTLES AS IT'S PUSHED AWAY]
#### GODBOLT
Wow. So this is what it looks like inside. Damn...
#### MEREDITH
Oi, that's my business you're talking about. Bit of respect, yeah?
##### [DOOR CREAKS; FOOTSTEPS]
#### GODBOLT
Business? Looks more like a shipwreck in here.
#### SHUHELA
Evening, love! What are you doing up here so late? I was just locking up!
##### [KEYS JANGLE]
(to Godbolt) I'm Shuhela, nice to meet you.
##### [FOOTSTEPS]
#### GODBOLT
Hi, Godbolt. I've heard a lot about you.
#### MEREDITH
He's lying. I've told him literally nothing.
#### SHUHELA
Oh, that's alright. He's just being polite, aren't you? Is she giving you the tour
then?
#### GODBOLT
(Slightly mocking) There's a tour! Goodness me, how exciting!
#### MEREDITH
Give it a rest, you sarcastic prick.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES; FOOTSTEPS]
#### SUZY
Hey Shuhela. Sorry, I'm so late, I got stuck in the traffic and-
#### SHUHELA
Suzy! Come say hello. This is Harold's sister, Meredith, and her friend... GGodbolt? Is that right?
#### SUZY
We've met.
#### MEREDITH
(Recognising) Ohhhh! Hey.
#### GODBOLT
Listen, forget this. Why don't we just hit that place I told you about, it's twofor-one until ten.
#### MEREDITH
No, we, we just got here.
#### GODBOLT
No. Yeah, I know but they're already locking up here anyway, so how about I
get us a taxi, and we just go have ourselves a good time, yeah?
#### MEREDITH
Well, I mean, I guess? If that's what y-
##### [DEPARTING FOOTSTEPS]
#### GODBOLT
Give me five minutes!
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### MEREDITH
Weird.
#### SHUHELA
(To Suzy) Ooh, she's done alright there, hasn't she?
You didn't find him in Gravesby, did you?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, actually. Wild, I know.
#### SHUHELA
Huh. Will wonders never cease.
##### [AWKWARD SILENCE]
#### SUZY
So Shuhela, about that charger...
#### SHUHELA
Oh right, yes! Of course love, back in a tick.
##### [FOOTSTEPS; DOOR CREAKS]
#### MEREDITH
So... Frank said you're probably a...
#### SUZY
Charity case? Yep, that's me.
Vampire. Recovering, obviously.
#### MEREDITH
Right.
#### ...
Tell you what, you scared the shit out of me climbing up that wall like that.
#### SUZY
Yeah... about that...
#### MEREDITH
It was awesome!
#### SUZY
(Thrown) What?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah it was brilliant! And, like, your teeth were all [VAMPIRIC MOUTH
SOUNDS] absolutely fantastic. Ten out of ten!
#### SUZY
Oh, well, thanks, I guess?
#### MEREDITH
So, er, while I have you... can I ask you a couple of questions? About, you
know, vamping? Vampiring?
#### SUZY
(Unsure) Uh, sure.
#### MEREDITH
Wicked. Okay so, first question. What's the deal with the garlic cos, like, I've
never understood that?
#### SUZY
Yeah, well, it's, um, not actually a thing. I quite like garlic bread.
#### MEREDITH
Uh-huh. And daylight?
#### SUZY
Stings your eyes a bit. Um, we just need to wear shades.
#### MEREDITH
Okay, that's not so bad. And your teeth? Where do they... go? Y'know, when
they're not all [VAMPIRIC MOUTH SOUNDS]?
#### SUZY
Ah-hah, well, they just sort of... retract.
#### MEREDITH
Cool. Cool.
Can you turn into a bat?
#### SUZY
No.
#### MEREDITH
Wolf?
#### SUZY
No.
#### MEREDITH
What about, like, a horde of rats?
#### SUZY
(Chuckling) Oh yeah. We do that all the time for a laugh.
#### MEREDITH
Really?
#### SUZY
No.
#### MEREDITH
Damn.
#### SUZY
Sorry.
#### MEREDITH
S'all right. So, I mean, the big question is, what, what about the blood-sucking
stuff. Does it taste really good or...?
##### [SUZY MAKES A SOFT SOUND OF AWKWARDNESS]
(Realising) Oh, hey, sorry. That, that was... that was shit of me. No, yeah, I
didn't mean anything by it. It's just, um, you're the first one I've met, y'know?
Forget about it, it's none of my business. You do you; no judgment here.
#### SUZY
No... I mean, it's alright. Just... I wouldn't go around the ICS asking stuff like
that.
It gets pretty old when it's the only thing anyone ever wants to talk to you
about. And... no-one owes you an explanation, yeah?
#### MEREDITH
Gotcha.
#### SUZY
Alright. So the blood thing is... hard to explain. I mean, it's not the stuff itself,
like the smell or the taste or whatever...
It's what it does to you.
Like... You know when you just wanna get completely out of your head for
whatever reason? Like, you just decide that screw it, tonight you are just going
to wreck yourself?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, I know that.
#### SUZY
Yeah, but then sometimes you can find that sweet spot where everything is
just- just goes away for a bit, and you feel like... like everything is gravy for a
while.
#### MEREDITH
Yeah.
#### SUZY
Yeah, it's like that. Times a million.
#### MEREDITH
Doesn't sound so bad.
#### SUZY
Mmhmm. And then you wake up. And you still have to deal with everything
that made you drink in the first place, except it's all ten times worse because of
all the shit you did the night before. And now you have to fix the things, twice
as fast otherwise you're screwed. And it's just... you know...
#### MEREDITH
Never-ending?
#### SUZY
Yeah, exactly. And you, you can't take a moment to sort your shit out, because
part of you knows that if you do, it'll be a lot worse than you're admitting. And
then that moment of peace starts to feel really inviting again. And... yeah, well.
#### MEREDITH
Changed my mind. That sounds proper shit.
#### SUZY
It is. Was.
But that was before. And now we're all keeping dry and keeping it together.
And it's better when you have other people with you, so... yeah.
#### MEREDITH
Cool. It's good you're getting help. Help is... good.
Listen, you know what, I've been a total prick quizzing you on this-
#### SUZY
Forget about it.
#### MEREDITH
No, I shouldn't have been so... yeah. Total prick. I'm sorry.
#### SUZY
Okay.
##### [DOOR CREAKS, FOOTSTEPS]
#### SHUHELA
Sorry about that, love. It's never where you leave it, right? Here you are.
##### [ITEM CHANGES HANDS]
Everything alright out here?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah.
#### SUZY
More or less.
#### SHUHELA
Oh, I am glad. For a moment there, I thought Mr Fabulous Arse would drive us
apart!
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, speaking of, where the hell has he gone?
##### [GENERAL MOVEMENT AS SHUHELA LOCKS UP]
#### SUZY
Have you known him long?
##### [FOOTSTEPS HEAD DOWN STAIRS]
#### MEREDITH
Godbolt? Nah, only a couple of days. He seems alight though. Why? He's not
your ex or something, is he?
#### SUZY
No... not Godbolt. Ah... just be careful with him, yeah? Don't let him lead you
on.
##### [FOOTSTEPS; DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
#### MEREDITH
Well that's ominous.
#### TOWN HALL, MEETING ROOM -- MORNING
##### [PAPER RUSTLES AS HAROLD REHEARSES]
#### HAROLD
'Since 2012, the North-West has seen the highest rise of... highest rise of...'
Shitting hell! I had it last night. Shit, shit, fucking shit.
#### SHUHELA
Relax, love. You're gonna be absolutely fine. I'm here, Cressida's here...
#### FRANK
if all else fails, you can always blag it.
#### HAROLD
Blag it? Blag it? Oh yeah, I'll just go in there and start pulling stats out of my
arse, shall I? I'm sure that'll go down really well.
##### [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]
#### CRESSIDA
Good news, everybody. Looks like William Allen is a no show. They've tried his
office, his mobile, Lily's mobile; no-one can get hold of him.
#### FRANK
Convenient.
#### CRESSIDA
Yes, isn't it? So, is he ready?
#### SHUHELA
Yes!
#### HAROLD
No.
#### CRESSIDA
That's the spirit. Come on then.
##### [FOOTSTEPS; DOOR OPENS/CLOSE]
##### [GENERAL MURMUR OF VOICES AS FOLKS TAKE THEIR SEATS]
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Good morning everyone. Sorry for the delay. Uh, as you can see we're a man
down already, but after some deliberation we have decided it is in everyone's
best interests to press on regardless.
With that in mind I'd like to thank the... uh... [PAPERS RUSTLE] The ISC-
#### SHUHELA
(Calling) ICS!
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Oh my apologies. Ah yes, I'd like to thank ICS for their patience. Now, I
understand we have their CEO speaking to us today regarding... ah yes, St
Mark's on Cruttenden Street. Is that correct?
##### [CHAIR SCRAPES]
#### HAROLD
Yes, your honour that's... Hello, yes. Harold Stonewell.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Good morning. You don't need to stand, but it is appreciated. Also, uh, I'm not
a judge, so Councillor should suffice.
#### HAROLD
Oh, um, yes. Councillor.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Excellent. Now as we all know, St Mark's is currently under public
management, and as such we have several enterprises vying for the acquisition
rights. It's your job, Mr Stonewell, to tell us why we should give it to ICS. In
your own time, please.
##### [PAPERS RUSTLE AS HAROLD NERVOUSLY FUMBLES]
#### HAROLD
Yes. Uh. Hmm, yes that's- Yes, well, I, I, I, I, I, I wanted to-
(DROPS PAPER)
Oh f- Sorry.
(RETRIEVES PAPER, CLEARS THROAT)
I wanted to speak to you all today about the crisis we face, over... over... um...
Over-population! Um, recession. Rising living costs, et cetera, et cetera,
indeed! Who here hasn't heard these terms? None of us. None of us haven't
heard these terms.
FRANK (BACKGROUND)
Good grief...
SHUHELA (BACKGROUND)
Shhh!
#### HAROLD
And um... We can no longer ignore them, or even avoid them. No!
Gravesby is a micro... uh, a microcosm of these wider world issues, and so, as
such, we need to, to, to, to, to look at the bigger picture in order to make best
our understanding of the smaller picture. Which in itself is part of the bigger
picture, you see?
##### [MUTED COUGHS]
Er, yes. Well, right. Um. So, since 2012 the North-West has seen the highest
levels of cuts to local services, to government schemes, to- Uh... uh...
##### [MOBILE PHONE BUZZES SOFTLY, AND IS ANSWERED]
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #1
(Quietly) Ian, hi, no, I'm in session. Oh not long, it seems open and shut. I'll call
you back in ten.
##### [PHONE CALL CUTS OFF]
My apologies. Do continue.
#### HAROLD
Yes. Okay.
So to, uh... to, uh...
SHUHELA (BACKGROUND)
Government schemes!
#### HAROLD
Oh yes, yes. Um, government services- sorry, schemes, um, to, uh, for the
most basic facilities, a tax paying member of this community could and should
expect-
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr Stonewall.
#### HAROLD
Stonewell.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
But due to the delayed start, we, we are under certain time pressures. Can we
please just skip this preamble, thorough as it is, and address the primary
matter at hand: namely, that St Mark's is in a state of severe disrepair, and
given this fact, how can a social care organisation with no major public or
private funding possibly expect to realise these rather... (PAPERS RUSTLE)
ambitious plans that you've submitted to us?
#### HAROLD
Uh... Oh well... um... I, that is to say, we... we would, um... intend to-
##### [CHAIR SCRAPES; FOOTSTEPS]
#### CRESSIDA
Cressida Hynes, Chief Legal and Financial Officer to ICS. If I may, Councillor?
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Please.
#### CRESSIDA
You are correct that we would not be able to shoulder the costs of this alone.
That is why we would need assistance from the council to realise these plans.
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #2
I'm sorry, you expect us to hand over the church and pay you for your own
renovations, when other interested parties are willing to shoulder the entire
costs themselves?
#### CRESSIDA
I'll be blunt. The cost to the council for ICS to take over and renovate St Mark's
will be chicken feed in comparison to what you'll have to spend on rehousing
the homeless population if you don't. Assuming that you are going to rehouse
them, of course.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Miss Hynes, we have made it clear, time and time again, that we'll make no
provisions for vagrants who continually-
#### CRESSIDA
The fact is, Councillor, that every day the homeless in Gravesby remain without
shelter results in appalling, avoidable suffering.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Miss Hynes, I am sure we can all agree that homelessness in Gravesby is a
problem, but it is not the problem that we have been brought here to solve.
We are here to determine what is to happen to St Mark's.
#### CRESSIDA
Forgive me, Councillor, but these two problems are inseparable. Time and time
again, the local government has refused to offer any solutions to our
homelessness crisis. I would not presume to appeal to your conscience, but I
would suggest that you consider recent opinion polls regarding local
government.
##### [COUNCILLORS MURMUR]
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #3
(Whispering) Oh, why is she bringing it up?
#### CRESSIDA
People are not happy with you. Not at all.
##### [MURMURING INTENSIFIES]
But, happily, we are here presenting you with the solution. ICS can deal with
this because helping the homeless is what we already do. Day in, day out, year
in, year out. By granting the St Mark's site to ICS and assisting in the
renovations, you would be allowing us to finally end this issue once and for all,
with all the complexities neatly handled by us. You only need to sign a cheque.
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #3
You really expect to handle the entire homeless population of Gravesby within
a single facility? People with criminal records, emotional problems, drug
addictions? You're just going to lump them all in together and... what? Just
hope for the best?
#### CRESSIDA
No. We will provide the best, because we are the best. The site is large enough
for two hundred interior beds and, further, two hundred in additional facilities
on the grounds and-
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #3
(Incredulous) Additional facilities?
#### CRESSIDA
Do you have an alternative? Because your current plan seems to be just
abandoning these people. Our work will keep them safe, and bring them back
into society. It's what we do, and we're very good at it. All we're asking for are
the basic facilities we need to solve your problem before it draws any more
unwanted attention. Like... the national press, for example.
##### [WHISPERING AS COUNCILLORS CONFER]
#### HAROLD
(Aside) Should I do the rest of my speech now?
#### CRESSIDA
(Aside) Maybe hold off for now. I think they've got enough to consider.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
It is at this point we would customarily hear any arguments against the
proposal. However, given the absence of any formal opposition to these
proceedings, I suggest we should just press on and put the motion to a vote.
Any objections?
#### ...
Very well. In that case, all those in favour of allowing ICS acquisition rights to St
Marks along with the necessary funding to allow basic renovation, please say
aye.
#### COUNCIL MEMBERS
Aye.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
And those against?
#### COUNCIL MEMBERS
Nay.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
The ayes have it seven to five, no abstainers. Motion is carried. Thank you all.
#### SHUHELA
(Loudly) Get in!
##### [SHUHELA GASPS AS FRANK LAUGHS]
(Whispers) Oh! Sorry!
#### HAROLD
Did we win? Did I-?
#### CRESSIDA
Congratulations, Harold. You just bought yourself a church.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
With no further motions proposed, we are hereby adjourned for this session. If
we can please clear the chambers.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES; FOOTSTEPS STRIDE IN]
#### WILLIAM
(To Lily) --the second we are done here you get onto the transport
department and you tell them that they are going to do something about that
corner tomorrow, understand?
(To the room, politely) Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sorry for the delay.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Ah, Bill, we've been calling you. Is, is everything all right?
#### WILLIAM
Yes, thankfully nothing serious. Although the car's in a bit of a nasty state. Lily
here got caught out on that bloody blind spot on Cressington Way. We're lucky
we didn't end up smeared across the dual carriageway.
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Bill, if, if you've been in an accident, it's, it's probably best we run you down to
the Royal and get you both checked up.
##### [FOOTSTEPS AS WILLIAM MOVES AROUND]
#### LILY
Uh, no!
#### WILLIAM
Lily, you have had enough input for one day.
No, no that won't be necessary. We're both fine. Besides, this has been
delayed quite long enough. I know we're behind, and I see our friends from ICS
are here, so, let's crack on shall we?
#### CRESSIDA
Perhaps we should update our friend and colleague on the motion... carried.
#### WILLIAM
“Carried”? What do you mean “motion carried”?
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
We've already ruled on ICS' proposal.
#### WILLIAM
Oh, good! So, who are we considering next?
##### [PAUSE, WITH SOME MUTED COUGHING]
Oh. You have got to be- You haven't given them the rights!?
#### CRESSIDA
And some additional funding besides.
#### WILLIAM
WHAT? It's not even eleven! You were in here for less than an hour!
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #2
Well, we were waiting for you for more than half an hour.
#### WILLIAM
Yes, well, my phone was damaged in the car crash that just nearly killed me, so
apologies for the inconvenience, Linda!
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Bill, why don't we just go outside, and, and you can calm down-
#### WILLIAM
You can't just carry a motion without me! I'm the bloody Mayor!
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #2
That's not how it works and you know it. We put the motion to the house and
the vote was cast, seven to five. If you'd been here to register your objections,
well then maybe-
#### WILLIAM
(Irate) This is absolutely ridiculous! Jesus! I turn my back for 5 minutes and you
just completely- Christ on a bike!
#### LILY
Look, William, I think it would be wise to-
#### WILLIAM
Will you shut! Up! Lily!
(To the room) I will be taking formal action against this, you know that? There
will be a proper investigation into what has happened here, and I will speak to
each of you in turn.
#### COUNCIL MEMBER #1
Oh, give over Bill. It's done.
#### WILLIAM
I will not “give over”!
#### CRESSIDA
If there's anything we can do to help, just drop us an email.
#### WILLIAM
You made a mistake today, Cressida, and you will come to regret it very soon!
#### COUNCIL SPEAKER
Bill... Bill.
#### WILLIAM
(To Lily) Get me everything we have on ICS, now. Everything!
##### [FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING]
#### LILY
Yes, of course, sir. I'll get straight onto it.
##### [DOOR OPENS/CLOSES]
##### [BACKGROUND NOISE OF COUNCILLORS MILLING AROUND]
#### FRANK
What a tit.
#### SHUHELA
I never know what people see in him. I just worry for Lily. That poor girl, she
must get a right earful from him.
#### CRESSIDA
I wouldn't worry about her; she can handle herself, trust me. Besides, it's all
hot air.
#### HAROLD
So that's it? We won?
#### CRESSIDA
Yes, Harold. We won.
#### HAROLD
And my speech helped?
#### SHUHELA
It was wonderful, love. Dead inspiring, weren't it, Frank?
#### FRANK
Mmmm.
#### CRESSIDA
It was perfect. We make an excellent team, and your mother would be very
proud. But now, it's time to celebrate. I am going to take you all out for dinner.
#### SHUHELA
Oh! I'll need to stop off and scrub up. You'll have to get your suit out too,
Frank!
#### FRANK
Eurgh.
#### SATIE'S RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
##### [FOOTSTEPS]
#### SUZY
(Quietly) Everyone's looking at us...
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, cos we're well fit. Let them look.
#### HAROLD
(Tipsy) Eyyyy there she is. My dear sister, and-
##### [DRINK SPLASHES AS HE YELPS ON RECOGNISING SUZY]
Uh. Hello.
#### SUZY
(Nervous) Yes, hello again Harold.
#### SHUHELA
Suzy! Lovely of you to join us. Come sit over here with me, pet.
#### CRESSIDA
Well, don't you both look lovely. How about some more drinks? Yes?
#### MEREDITH
Orange juice. Thanks.
#### HAROLD
(Snorting) Juice? Really? You're not pregnant, are you?
#### SUZY
Just a Coke for me, please.
#### SHUHELA
Oooh, everything looks so nice! I dunno what to have!
#### FRANK
You'll have the fish.
#### SHUHELA
Hang on, what makes you think that?
#### FRANK
You always get the fish.
#### SHUHELA
I don't always get the-
#### CRESSIDA
So! Now that we're all here, I just wanted to take a moment to say a few
words.
##### [CHAIRS SCRAPE]
#### HAROLD
Speeeeeech!
#### CRESSIDA
Yes, thank you, Harold. Anyway, I just wanted to extend my gratitude to
everyone. This has been a long time coming, but our efforts have finally been
rewarded. I couldn't be more proud of you all.
#### HAROLD
(Laughing) Crusty old bastards never saw us coming, did they?
#### CRESSIDA
Indeed.
Well, that's everything apart from telling you all: enjoy yourselves! The tab's
on me. You've earned it.
##### [GLASSES CLINK AMIDST GENERAL RESTAURANT NOISE AND CHATTER]
#### SHUHELA
Oh, I meant to ask, Frank -- how's Hannah doing?
#### FRANK
I swung by this morning but she didn't answer. Still upset with me, I reckon.
#### SHUHELA
Aww, she'll come round.
#### FRANK
Mmm.
#### HAROLD
So, are you really not drinking? What's brought all this on?
##### [CHAIR SCRAPES]
#### MEREDITH
Right, I'm going for a cigarette.

You really do have a pair of balls on you, I'll give you that. Just rocking up here
after totally bailing on me earlier.
#### GODBOLT
Yeah, sorry about before. I shouldn't have- I just- yeah. That was really
uncool. Got you flowers.
##### [FOLIAGE RUSTLES]
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, I can see that.
#### GODBOLT
And?
#### MEREDITH
And I'm out with the work lot, so can you just, like, go? And I'll call you, or
whatever.
#### GODBOLT
Come off it, I'm here to rescue you! You don't want to hang around with this
sad lot. Why don't we just get out of here? You and me, go get a drink, paint
the town-
#### MEREDITH
I said back off. Is that clear enough for you?
#### GODBOLT
Wait. You're serious?
##### [FOOTSTEPS BACK OFF]
Riiiight. Okay, fine. I'll just... Fine. Whatever.
##### [FOLIAGE RUSTLES AS IT'S DUMPED AND GODBOLT HEADS OFF]

#### SUZY
He didn't look happy. Everything alright?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah. Just peachy.
#### SUZY
You sure?
#### MEREDITH
Me? I'm fucking fabulous. I am living the dream.
#### SUZY
I know it's none of my business, but you did the right thing. You're better off
without him.
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, well. I don't need a babysitter.
#### SUZY
No, you don't.
#### ...
Are you coming back inside?
#### MEREDITH
Yeah, screw it. Let's eat, I'm starving.
What are you having?
#### SUZY
I thought I'd start with the garlic bread.
##### [MEREDITH SNORTS]
##### [FOOTSTEPS; DOOR OPENS]
#### MEREDITH
You alright Cressida?
#### CRESSIDA
Hmmm? Oh yes. Just grabbing some fresh air.
#### MEREDITH
Well, I wouldn't leave that lot unsupervised with an open tab.
#### CRESSIDA
I'll be back in a moment. Uh, keep an eye on them in the meantime, won't
you?
##### [DOOR CLOSES]
##### [FOOTSTEPS APPROACH]
You're late.
#### LILY
Sorry, sorry, I got held up and, and-
#### CRESSIDA
Yes, I'm sure. Sterling work with William earlier. It's appreciated.
#### LILY
He's been in a foul mood ever since. Will be for the rest of the week.
#### CRESSIDA
Still, I'm sure it's worth it, yes?
#### LILY
Um. Yes.
#### CRESSIDA
Good girl. Here's the rest of your... payment, as discussed.
##### [RUSTLING OF PAPER PACKAGE]
And before you ask, yes, it's fresh.
#### LILY
Thanks. I know it's sounds daft but it does make a difference, you know, and-
#### CRESSIDA
Just take it, dear. I'd rather I wasn't carrying it any longer than necessary.
##### [RUSTLING AS LILY ACCEPTS PACKAGE]
I'll be in touch.
