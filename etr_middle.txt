Rusty Quill Presents: The Magnus
Protocol.
Episode Thirteen -- Futures
##### [Music]
#### 1. INT. PLEASANT RESTAURANT -- EVENING, CLEAR (SAM'S
PHONE)
There is a pleasant murmur of conversation combined with soft
piano music coming in over speakers. It's a well-chosen date spot,
fancy enough to matter without being ostentatious. Sam and Celia
sit opposite one another.
#### SAM
So what are we thinking?
#### CELIA
On the one hand, this technically
counts as breakfast so I should
probably go with something light, but
on the other... I'm in the mood for rich
and cheesy. Choices, choices.
#### SAM
Yeah, I must admit, it is kinda weird
waking up then immediately going out
on a dinner date.
#### CELIA
Yeah, working nights is taking some
getting used to.
#### SAM
You seem all right.
#### CELIA
You're not too bad yourself.
#### SAM
(blushing)
I, Heh- uh...
Celia laughs. A waiter arrives.
#### WAITER
Are we ready to order?
#### CELIA
I'll have the baked camembert and
he's...
#### SAM
I'll have the same, thank you.
#### WAITER
Very good.
The waiter departs.
#### CELIA
Alice was right -- it is easy to make you
blush..
#### SAM
You just caught me unawares.
#### CELIA
Of course.
#### SAM
So you asked her about me?
#### CELIA
Just doing my due diligence.
#### SAM
And what else did she say about me?
#### CELIA
That you don't know how cute you are.
#### SAM
(pleased)
Oh. Well...
#### CELIA
...and that you're an overachiever,
obsessive, a bit repressedSAM
OkayCELIA
-nosey, kind of a recluseSAM
Thank you.
#### CELIA
-and very easy to wind up.
Beat.
#### SAM
Well, she's not wrong, I guess. So who
do I talk to to get a complete list of your
flaws?
#### CELIA
No-one. I'm mysterious.
#### SAM
Hmmm. Well jokes aside we should
probably just get all of our baggage out
on the table now. It's risky enough
dating at work without adding
bombshell revelations to the mix.
#### CELIA
You want to start with the big stuff? Ok
then.
CELIA settles herself.
#### CELIA
(cont.)
I have a baby. Jack. He's just over a
year old now.
#### SAM
Cool.
Beat.
#### CELIA
And before you ask, no there's no dad
on the scene. Not even sure who he is. I
had a couple of wild years after I moved
here. It was a really weird time for me,
but somehow I got lucky enough to
come out of it all with him.
#### SAM
Fair enough. Do I get to meet him?
#### CELIA
That depends on your baggage. Dish.
#### SAM
All right...
SAM arranges his own thoughts.
#### SAM
(cont.)
No kids of my own. Both my parents are
still around. I haven't worked up the
nerve to tell them that I bailed on my
last job yet.
#### CELIA
They'd care that much?
#### SAM
I was tested as a kid and, uh, they said I
was “gifted” so mum and dad got a bee
in their bonnet and enrolled me in every
“enrichment” program they could findCELIA
Like The Magnus Institute?
#### SAM
No. They were the first ones that didn't
want me.
#### CELIA
That why you're so hung up on them?
#### SAM
I don't know. Maybe? That definitely
feels like when it all started.
#### CELIA
When what started?
#### SAM
Well after that it all just went downhill.
Didn't get into Oxford, so I went to
Nottingham. I graduated but I missed a
first by one mark. Then I went to work
at a legal firm. I was there for years,
hoping they'd eventually sponsor me
for a law degree.
#### CELIA
And?
SAM sighs.
#### SAM
I had a breakdown. Stress. There was
an... incident at work. I... freaked out
during a presentation. After that they
“encouraged” me to move on and I did.
Six unemployed months later and I took
a job at the O.I.A.R.
#### CELIA
(Slightly cautious)
Alice hooked you up?
#### SAM
(noticing)
Yeah. Uh Full disclosure, we dated at
Uni and stayed in contact after. I did my
best to help her though her parents'
deaths but after that we pretty much
dropped out of touch. According to her
she dropped me a line about the job
after “the most pathetic vague-post she
had ever seen”.
#### CELIA
And now?
#### SAM
Now she's a friend. An insufferable,
obnoxious know-it-all friend but yeah,
just a friend.
#### CELIA
All right then.
Pause, they both drink.
#### SAM
That everything we think?
#### CELIA
Yeah. I did want to ask you, though...
#### SAM
(Bracing himself)
All right...
#### CELIA
The cases, at work. Do you think they're
real?
Beat.
#### SAM
Do you?
#### CELIA
I asked you first.
Beat.
#### SAM
I... don't know. I hope not. You?
#### CELIA
I'm pretty sure they're real.
Awkward pause.
#### SAM
More wine?
#### CELIA
Please.
SAM pours.
The call ends abruptly.
#### 2. INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, LIGHT RAIN
(MANAGER'S LANDLINE)
GWEN enters the office and stands silent and shaking. Lena looks
up calmly.
#### LENA
Can I help you Gwen?
#### GWEN
Is it my fault?
#### LENA
You'll have to be more specific.
#### GWEN
Bonzo. One of the cases. Did it really
happen? Was it because of me?
Beat.
#### LENA
Yes. Whatever horrible case you read, it
happened.
Beat. GWEN reacts.
#### GWEN
And am I responsible?
#### LENA
To a degree.
Beat.
#### GWEN
Tell me why.
Beat. Lena stands and sits against her desk.
#### LENA
Sit.
#### GWEN
I don't want- [to sit]
#### LENA
Sit.
Gwen does so, unsteadily.
#### LENA
(cont.)
The world is full of opposing forces,
some benevolent, most not. In order for
the wheels to keep on turning, all these
forces need to be monitored and
balanced. That is where we come in.
#### GWEN
That doesn't mean anything.
#### LENA
And yet it is the only explanation you're
going to get for now.
#### GWEN
So what? We're the bad guys?
#### LENA
We are... managing the “bad guys”..
Beat.
#### LENA
(cont. returning to her desk)
There should be an email in your inbox.
We have another external that needs
assignment. It's quite urgent.
Beat.
#### LENA
(cont.)
Gwen?
#### GWEN
I'll sort it.
#### LENA
See that you do.
#### 3. INT. QUIET FRENCH HOSPITAL WARD -- SUNSET, CLOUDY

Beat.
Someone takes a deep breath, holds it shakily then exhales.
#### DARRIEN
(intense)
Listen you thieving bastards, I want my
money.
I don't care about your “suspicious
activity” bollocks, I have burnt my
entire life to the ground for this stupid
bloody app and now you owe me my
goddam money. So, you can either pay
up or I drop a line to the Ombudsman
and tell them all about your little
“Projection” trading, see what they
make of it.
Beat.
#### DARRIEN
(cont.)
You can't just take my money, lock me
out of your app, and then expect me to
roll over. I've been a user for years.
Hell, I've probably invested more via
this poxy little program than everyone
else put together and what do I have to
show for it? Eh?
You owe me.
So either give me my money or... Or I'llI'llBeat.
Is this meant to be, like, punishment or
something? I'm not a bad person, all
right?
Wanting to be rich doesn't make you a
bad person. Sure, most rich people are
dicks but most of them started that
way. Hell, most of them got to be rich
because they were dicks.
You don't even know me. I mean, sure, I
went to a Public school but I got there
on a scholarship and I worked my ass
off. I hid it from the other lads, of
course I did, otherwise they'd have
ripped the piss out of me. One time I
even faked a broken leg just to get out
of admitting I couldn't afford a skiing
trip. Classic.
'Course mum and dad weren't happy
but they'd been dirt poor their whole
lives so what did they know?
I earned everything I got. Most of the
other lads went to uni, Oxbridge and
that, but not me. I had “the plan”. While
the rest of them were stuck translating
Plato or whatever I would be out there
earning bank.
I took my entire student loan out and
got straight to shorting using your app.
This was back when it had only just
launched. I struggled through your first
janky interface, your weird background
checks, all those damn glitches but I
stuck with it because unlimited Margins
and Deposits was pretty sweet. Made
some quick cash shorting failing
startups then used that to broaden into
Crypto, leveraged some EM ETFS,
scraped up a few pennies then started
to go long on a few obvious winners
like Omni and Sparkhub for some
hedging. Easy peasy.
It was good. It was working. I'd meet up
with the lads and suddenly I was the
one buying the good stuff. And sure,
money can't buy you love, but you'd be
amazed what personal trainers, high
end surgery and hair plugs can achieve
on a speccy little finance nerd.
Life was good. Bloody expensive but
good. I had a couple of close calls sure
but something always came along. God
bless Bitcoin amirite?
So yeah, then I got cocky and I bet
against the big man himself. I shorted
Dantex hard in 2020. Stupid, really, but
the whole Zurich thing had wiped a
bunch out of my portfolio and I got a
tipoff from one of the lads. So I went all
in.
And no, I don't blame Zorrotrade for
that. But it was a bad time.
I remember I was sitting on deck with
Oli, watching the sun set in the Riviera
and I was ready to close up shop. I
grabbed my phone and started messing
with the settings looking to settle up.
That was when I noticed your new:
“Personal Projection Short Selling”
feature. It was disabled, buried under
advanced lab settings and covered in
disclaimers without any explanation but
it still grabbed me. I had no idea what it
was and there was nothing about it
online
Just that one slider with the warning:
“These settings are experimental and
may not function as intended, user
discretion is advised.” You really think
that is enough after what you've done
to me?
But hey, screw it, I figured I was already
basically broke, what did I have to lose.
I flicked it on and a new dialogue
window opened with two words:
“Investment Amount”. Bear in mind that
at this point I barely had a pot to piss
in. So I put in my last few grand. Why
the hell not?
The phone pinged and a little approving
tick appeared and then it was gone.
Nothing else. I carried on drinking and
passed out around 4am.
Oli kicked me shoreside in “Le Brusc”
the next evening. He wasn't too
impressed with the mess I had made of
his guest cabin and let's be honest, we
didn't really get on anyway. He dumped
me at the dock with nowhere to stay
and told me he'd send me a bill for the
#### TV.
I tried calling up one of the other lads
but no-one was picking up. That was
when I checked the group chat. Turns
out I must have run my mouth the night
before because now Oli had told
everyone I was broke. Apparently, they
always knew I'd “end up back in the
gutter eventually.” I was just writing a
proper response when my phone died.
I'd been borrowing Oli's charger.
Beat. There's a beep on the call.
#### DARRIEN
Yeah, I know I'm going long with this,
but tough. You can just shut up and
listen. So it turns out that stepping off
a yacht, alone, in some pissant fishing
dock in the arse end of nowhere, in the
middle of the night with a thousand
dollar case and a lost look on your face
is a good way to get yourself mugged.
They took everything. The case, my
watch, my jacket, even my shoes. But
not my phone. Dunno why, it's like they
didn't even notice it. Kicked the hell out
of me, though. Talk about rock
bottom...
It took a while to convince anyone to let
me borrow their charger and call the
British embassy. Took me even longer
to get through to the embassy. They
told me to go online for an emergency
travel permit and it was as I was
applying for it, that I saw a new email
ping up from my bank app. “Deposit
received” I opened it and got as far as
“remaining balance: one hundred
thousand and eighty three pounds,
twelve pence“ before I was I was back
on Zorrotrade reading a notification:
“Congratulations! In recognition of your
change in circumstances, you're
Personal Projection Short Sell has now
been paid in full. We hope you invest
again soon!”
Somehow, when I was pissed out my
skull, I'd used the app to bet against
myself and come out ahead. It didn't
make any sense but when I checked
with the bank, there it was all was,
every penny.
Obviously you hadn't worked the bugs
out of this projection thing yet but
that's your problem. Not mine. It's not
like I hacked it or anything.
Still, I knew it was probably a fluke.
Time to call it quits.
Only, that's the thing with money. It
multiplies, especially when you're good
at finding loopholes.
Maybe I should have focused on how it
worked but the wheels were already
turning. If by some bizarre twist this
really was shorting against what, my
own life? I could make bank. I just
needed to nudge things in a bad
direction and the payout would grow...
And no, it wasn't fraud. I've checked
and there's no regulations about it or
anything, so like I said: your app, your
problem...
I started with a couple of small tests.
Nothing huge. I bet a thousand quid
then picked a fight with the biggest
stranger I could. It cost me a tooth
but... four hundred profit. A good return
but it didn't cover the dental bill to get it
properly fixed. I tried again, this time
betting 10k before renting a car (with
insurance) and crashing it into a tree at
speed. That messed my leg up pretty
badly and I got a faceful of glass but I
also got 50k profit. That was more like
it. I spent a few weeks breaking myself,
and sabotaging my life, in various
ways, and by the end I'd banked a cool
mil.
It was just so liberating, so addictive,
literally cashing in my misery into cold,
hard cash. So as the sun set over the
harbor I opened the app again and dug
straight through to the Personal
Projection Short Selling box:
“Investment Amount” One million
pounds, 'You Only Live Once' right?
Again, the little ping and the tick. Then
it was time to go for a walk.
I'd picked out the spot the day before, a
cliff about an hour and a half's walk
uphill near some old monastery or
whatever called Notre-Dam du Mai. It
had a decent view if you're into that
kind of thing but more importantly it
was high. Just high enough to really
hurt me, not enough to kill me. Or so I
hoped.
On the way I made a few phone calls,
first to my parents, telling them I never
loved them and hoped they died
horribly, next I was on the group chat
with the lads telling each of them just
how many times I slept with their
partners, even when I hadn't. Then it
was on to my socials publicly declaring
my affiliation with every messed up
ideology and psychopath I could find. I
ran out of time before I could confess to
robbing orphanages to buy drugs but I
think I made my point.
Then I got to the cliff. It felt much taller
standing at the top. There was a
surprisingly chill wind blowing across
the edge, driven upwards from the sea
and that coupled with the sheerness of
the drop gave me a moment of vertigo. I
hesitated. Was this really worth it?
Beat
#### DARRIEN
(cont.)
I jumped.
Beat
#### DARRIEN
(cont.)
I woke up here at l'hopital Jean-Marcel,
2 days later. Apparently, I was in a
medically induced coma since they
found me. One leg was amputated and
the other is full of pins. Cracked spine
in two places, ruptured spleen, 6
broken ribs and a cracked skull. Every
second hurts.
But when I woke up I couldn't be
happier.
I was alive sure, but more than that I
was rich, properly rich, untouchably
rich. Everything was going to be okay.
Everyone crowded me when I woke up
but I just kept demanding my phone
until finally one of the nurses gave up
and handed it over.
I had about a thousand missed calls but
I skipped straight to Zorrotrader. I
braced myself, looked down and there it
was. Almost fifty million. But... there
was a tiny symbol to the left of the
figure. A minus symbol. And then I saw
your notice.
“Your payment has been suspended
due to suspicious account activity
including potential insider trading.
Official bodies have been notified.
Please repay your outstanding balance
or prepare for Personal Adjustment.”
That was twelve hours ago and no
matter what I do I can't seem to get
through to anybody.
So yeah, I need my money.
I didn't do anything wrong I just... used
a loophole, that's all. You can't blame
me for playing the system.
Besides I've got nothing left. Nothing.
So just, give me my goddamn money.
Beat.
#### DARRIEN
Oh, right. Darrien Laurel. Account
number 428813.
#### ANSWERPHONE
Thank you. You are being transferred to
our adjustments department.
Click. There is something on the other end of the phone. It clearly
isn't human. Metallic insectoid chittering grows louder.
#### DARRIEN
H- hello?
The chittering grows even louder. DARRIEN drops the phone.
#### DARRIEN
(cont.)
Oh god- what!? Nurse! NURSE!
Darrien screams. The call ends.
#### 4. INT. O.I.A.R. OFFICE -- NIGHT, DRIZZLING (COMPUTER).
SAM is quietly working. He's a little faster than he was but still
hardly “dynamic.” ALICE approaches.
#### ALICE
Coffee?
#### SAM
'fraid not. I'm still catching up.
#### ALICE
Yeah, that'll happen when you turn up
late and half-trollied.
#### SAM
I don't know what you're talking about.
#### ALICE
Those cheeks don't lie. Either you're
reading a particularly saucy case or
someone had a cheeky tipple before
work.
#### SAM
There may have been some wine.
#### ALICE
Come on then, how was it? Did your
eyes meet across a crowded
MacDonald's or was it more of a crate
of Buckfast under a bridge sort of
situation?
She gives a sarcastic wistful sigh.
#### SAM
It was nice.
#### ALICE
Nice, he says. Is she at least going to
make an honest woman out of you?
#### SAM
Alice, look, I'm not really comfortable
talking to you about this.
#### ALICE
Since when?
#### SAM
It's just- I get that you might not love
the idea of me seeing Celia, but... I just
think we should keep things a bit
more... professional now. You know?
#### ALICE
Professional.
#### SAM
Sorry, bad wording, but you know what
I mean.
Beat.
#### ALICE
(Hurt and failing to hide it)
No, you're right. I should probably stop
getting tattoos of your face and return
all your kidnapped pets...
#### SAM
AliceALICE
(Cont.)
It's fine, I get it, I'll just find a way to
soldier on somehow, despite this
crushing blow.
ALICE moves to leave.
#### SAM
Alice wait.
#### ALICE
What.
#### SAM
I just don't want things to get weird...
#### ALICE
Then you're in the wrong line of work.
#### SAM
Yeah.
Beat.
#### SAM
I'm sorry.
#### ALICE
(softening)
Yeah. Look, I'm... happy you're happy.
#### SAM
Thanks.
Beat.
#### ALICE
But if you ever ask me to be
professional again, I'm going to have to
take a shit on your desk.
#### SAM
That seems completely fair and
reasonable.
Alice moves to leave.
#### SAM
Hey...
#### ALICE
What?
#### SAM
(sighing)
We spent most of the time discussing,
if they are real. The cases.
#### ALICE
Sounds romantic.
#### SAM
So what do you think? Are they?
#### ALICE
Does it matter?
#### SAM
Yeah, kind of! If we're working for the
Men in Black or covering up ghosts or
whatever then shouldn't someone go to
the press or...
#### ALICE
Okay, a) You're drunk, b) You can't
prove anything and c) you signed the
official secrets act in your onboarding.
And I know all your school friends say
treason's “bussin'” and “fire”, but it
won't look good on your CV.
#### SAM
Yeah butALICE
Look Sam, you really want my opinion?
Sober up and stop trying to make an
impact. Just do the job and take your
pay.
#### SAM
And what, just ignore what's going on
right under my nose?
#### ALICE
(heading off)
Pretty much. Keep it professional.
#### SAM
(incredulous)
I'm sorry?
#### ALICE
It's ok when I say it.
SAM sighs and goes back to work.
