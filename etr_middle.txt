Transcriber's note: Alex & Jonny generally talk over the clips that have been selected. For ease,
we are replicating the main clip played, then presenting their commentary, rather than trying to
intersperse lines. The episode in question also continues to play, faded into the background.
#### ALEX
Hello listener, it's me, Alexander J Newall. And with me today, I have...
#### JONNY
Jonny. Jonny's here. Hooray!
#### ALEX
And we are here to do another commentary episode. This one is covering choices
made by Patrons. So these are the bits that Patrons really, really, really want us to
give low quality, kind of riffing around.
#### JONNY
It's great. It's going to be insights. I'm going to be saying funny stories, I promise. I
promise there'll be a funny story for every one of these clips.
#### ALEX
Eh, I don't know. I mean-
#### JONNY
Even if I have to make them up.
#### ALEX
Yeah. Right. Fictional quips. Here we go. Any last words before we get started?
#### JONNY
God help us all?
#### ALEX
No pressure Jonny, but you do also have to get all of these now encyclopaedically
correct.
#### JONNY
Yeah. That's fair.

“ARCHIVIST: Why are you still here?
MARTIN: (Considering) Don't really know. I just am. It didn't feel right to just
leave. I've typed up a few resignation letters, but I just couldn't bring myself to
hand them in.
I'm trapped here. It's like I can't... move on and the more I struggle, the more I'm
stuck.
ARCHIVIST: Martin...You're not, uh... You didn't die here, did you?
MARTIN: What? What? N-No... what?!
ARCHIVIST: No, I just... No, just the way you phrased that...
MARTIN: Made you think I was a ghost?
ARCHIVIST: No... it's-
MARTIN: No, no... it's just that whatever web these statements have caught you
in, well, I'm there too. We all are, I think. [SIGH]
#### ...
A ghost? Really?
ARCHIVIST: (Tiredly) Shut up Martin.”
#### ALEX
(Whispered) Why are you still here?
#### JONNY
You told me to be here for recording, Alex! I don't have another choice.
Oh, it's ghost.
#### ALEX
Yeah, I know where we are.
#### JONNY
It's ghost.
Funny story about this is... weirdly for quite a long section of Season 2, Alex
actually was a ghost. So when we were recording the Season 1 finale-
#### ALEX
You're not even waiting for the quiet bit; you're just diving right in! Gah...
#### JONNY
I know this one, it's like, 'Ohhhh, it's funny.' You know, misunderstandings...
To be fair, this is one of the first times in the series that I properly was just, like,
'You know what? I can do a joke. That's going to be fun.'
#### ALEX
You can't crosstalk over crosstalk, Jonny, you're mad!
#### JONNY
I'm tripling the crosstalk-
#### ALEX
You're a renegade
#### JONNY
Tripling the crosstalk.
#### ALEX
The thing I liked about that scene is there hasn't been much chance for true levity
earlier, because Season 1 has to take itself very seriously. It has a slightly tongue in
cheek start where it's like, 'I'm a bit officious so that you know who I am.'
##### [BACKGROUND VOICES OF THE SCENE BETWEEN SASHA AND
#### ELIAS]
#### JONNY
The Archivist is a bit of a joke in a lot of the ways, but the actual series, the actual
horror of it and the interactions have to be quite po-faced.
#### ALEX
But that meant that it was only once you had a big, you know, 'stuff's hitting the
fan' finale that you could then have...
#### JONNY
Just that moment.
Also. I love comedy that comes out of characters, like, engaging with very, like,
high nonsense, like, genre stuff in very real ways.
If you're like, 'Hang on ghosts are a thing.' There's a question of, like, 'Okay, well,
it does kind of sound like you're saying the stuff that you say when you realise
you're a ghost.'
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### JONNY
So I really enjoy those moments of, like, where genre awareness clashes.
#### ALEX
I'm really struggling with this, because I haven't heard this episode in about four
years, and I can still hear it running just a little bit underneath. And part of me is
just there going-
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
'Why's Lottie in the pod- Lottie is in the podcast! Yes. What? Why is there all
this-'
##### [BACKGROUND VOICES OF THE SCENE BETWEEN MARTIN, THE
#### ARCHIVIST AND TIM'S ARRIVAL]
#### JONNY
Oh, someone's- Oh it's Tim. This is Tim. This is Tim, turning up. Ah, Tim
without his trousers.
#### ALEX
More importantly, Happy Tim. I got too used to Angry Tim towards the end.
#### JONNY
Do you remember when we made Mike hold his breath for ages to do the scene
and he got really light-headed?
#### ALEX
He gets really light-headed really easily.
#### JONNY
Yeah. To be clear, we didn't force him to do this. We were like, you know, if you,
like, do the sort of faux-hyperventilating, it gives you a certain giddy energy. And
he went a little bit further I think that we intended.
#### ALEX
That whole scene was- That was a very fun one to record because as well, you
got to remember that at that point, we'd never done proper group recordings.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
Those are our first group recordings, and there's elements of, like, discovering that
Mike's not allowed to speak at the same time as other performers.
#### JONNY
Mike's deep bass rumble... Was that the first time we had to just, like, strap a
pillow to his chest?
#### ALEX
Yep! For a chunk of that, I remember we were in post-asbestos flat, and we were
all gathered around my table. And we were sat around the table in what was
effectively a purely empty room, I'd only really just moved into. And we- Even if
I shoved every single piece of furniture I owned in there, it was still basically just a
big blank room, which is why it's deliberately built a little bit reverby.
#### JONNY
Oh, that last one that Alex just told, that was the fake anecdote. The one about
Alex being a ghost is real.
#### ALEX
Oh, was it? Okay, cool. Great.
We're coming into our next one then.
#### JONNY
Alright, let's see.
#### ALEX
We're one for one, at least on knowing what we're talking about, which is good.
#### JONNY
I am strapped in.
##### [CLIP: MAG078 -- Distant Cousin]
“ARCHIVIST: I found this in the folder marked 9910602, where Gertrude's tape
had indicated I would find the statement of Dekker himself. There is nothing else
in there, but I think it tells me what I need to know. This thing, this “Not Sasha”,
it's tied to the table. It...
I found the tapes.
##### [TAPE NOISES]
SASHA (RECORDING): I thought it was pronounced “Kah-lee-o-pee?
ARCHIVIST: They were in her desk. Well hidden, but... If I'd been a bit more
thorough, if I...
##### [TAPE NOISES]
SASHA (RECORDING): It's just a scratch, Jon. I'll be fine. Can we begin?
ARCHIVIST: Was there anything I could have done? Could I have...
##### [TAPE NOISES]
SASHA (RECORDING): Hello? I see you. Show yourself.
##### [TAPE NOISES]
NOT!SASHA (RECORDING): Hello?”
#### JONNY
Oh no, I don't remember the numbers.
#### ALEX
Nice vocal waver.
#### JONNY
Oh, is this the revelation of the-? This is the revelation of the Not!Sasha.
#### ALEX
Ohhh!
#### JONNY
Oh god, yeah, the table.
This is the Archivist's misjudgement.
#### ALEX
Hmmm. Yeah.
#### JONNY
Yep.
#### ALEX
Here's a genuine fun fact. That whole bit of, “I thought it was pronounced 'cal-eeo-pee'” is because we had a big old back and forth-
#### JONNY
Yeah, we had a big old, I wouldn't have called it an 'argument'.
#### ALEX
Lottie, myself, Jonny...
- It's not a 'cal-ee-o-pee', it's a 'ca-lye-o-pee'.
- It's a 'cal-ee-o-pee'.
- How could it be a 'cal-ee-o-pee'?! That a s- That's the worst thing I've-
It's 'ca-lye-o-pee'.
#### JONNY
I've always said 'ca-lye-o-pee'.
#### ALEX
It's 'ca-lye-o-pee'. And then Lottie was adamant it was 'cal-ee-o-pee' and it's like,
'It's 'ca-lye-o-pee'!'
#### JONNY
Here's a fake fun fact: Alex plays the calliope.
##### [ALEX SPLUTTERS DERISIVELY]
#### ALEX
Alex has the coordination of a toddler. So I sincerely doubt That.
#### JONNY
To be fair, you did the sound editing on the calliope track. So... in a very real
way...
#### ALEX
Ah, no.
#### JONNY
No?
#### ALEX
Well, only sort of. So, that's a Sam, Sam, the Music Man original.
#### JONNY
Oh, is it a Sam original?
#### ALEX
So as a result, I didn't actually generate that. I made it sound worse. He provided a
really good track and I went, 'I'm really sorry, Sam, I'm going to have to just
bastardise this.'
#### JONNY
Okay, so you commissioned a calliope track, which in a very real way, is that not
playing the calliope?
#### ALEX
You know what, you're correct. The fact that I commissioned The Magnus Archives,
in a lot of ways, means it's entirely my achievement! And we are all stood upon the
shoulders of my gianthood.
#### JONNY
What we really need to bear in mind here, when we think about the writing of
the... Shut up, Alex!
#### ALEX
I can't remember what comes after this though, to be honest, I should be listening.
#### JONNY
Oh, I think it's just the Archivist being, like 'I'm going to get vengeance.' And
coming up is the bit where he smashes up the table-
#### ALEX
Oh yeah!
#### JONNY
-and Michael is like, 'Mmm, that was stupid.'
#### ALEX
Oh, here's a question then, cos I know people always clock this line. Is it
surprisingly easy to buy an axe in central London?
#### JONNY
Yeah. Just go to Robert Dyas [a UK high street hardware retailer].
#### ALEX
It legitimately is, right! It's not just me.
#### JONNY
You can get them from hardware shops, and you do get hardware shops in central
London. It's just not something that you usually think to pick up, because there's
not a lot of things what need chopping.
#### ALEX
It's one of those weirdnesses of UK law as well, where it's like, you can go into the
shop and buy it, but you're kind of expected to teleport it to the destination.
#### JONNY
Oh yeah. Cos there are laws about what you can and can't carry around.
#### ALEX
Oh god, yeah. I remember the fan reactions too -- 'Really? Really John? You think
you can just take an axe to a table and solve the problem?'
#### JONNY
I don't know if I'd have jumped to the exact same conclusion, but certainly-
#### ALEX
Oh, I would have, straight away. Yeah.
#### JONNY
It's very much like, 'Okay. Well these things have ties to an artifact. So...
destroying the artifact-' Like, cos the thing is, in your classic ghost story,
destroying the thing that is tethering a monster does destroy that, like, tethering a
ghost does destroy the ghost.
#### ALEX
I really, really like, though, that it's the first case of -- it's John acting in a genresavvy way and then being punished for it.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
And that's why I really, really liked that bit. That tickled me when we were first
going over it cos it was just, 'Yeah, good. Let's punish people for daring to be
genre-savvy'.
##### [CLIP: MAG082 -- The Eyewitnesses']
“ELIAS: Statement of Alice Tonner, regarding the crimes and death of Calvin
Benchley. Statement never given.
DAISY: Don't.
ELIAS (STATEMENT): Everyone calls me Daisy. I like that because it sounds
so gentle, and I'm the only one left who knows about the scar on my back. It
doesn't really look like a daisy, more like a starburst, but it's what the doctor said
when I got it, so that's how I've always seen it. It makes me feel strong, to know
that the soft nickname everyone calls me comes from a bloody wound. And I like
to feel strong. To be in control.
DAISY: I'm going to kill you, someday.
ELIAS (STATEMENT): When I was eleven, I had a best friend, and his name
was Calvin Benchley. We didn't hang out at school much because his friends said I
couldn't play with them because I was a girl. But every day after getting home we'd
go to the nearby park and play. It was small, just a scrap of grass and dirt, but if
you hopped the fence to the south you could get into the cemetery, and if you
went the other way you got into an old building site. The fence on that side was
broken and jagged, but it collapsed enough that it was easy to climb over it, into
the half-built structure.”
#### JONNY
Oh... It's Elias giving Daisy's statement.
#### ALEX
Ohhhh, yeah, I forgot we did this.
#### JONNY
Yeah...
This is, I think Elias' first major, like, twisting the knife.
#### ALEX
I remember being really happy with 'how do we do the superpower thing with
Elias?' Because the connection's quite similar, which is, you have a problem in
Season 5, which people never really address, which is, do you have any idea how
difficult it can be to have an omniscient protagonist?!
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
No-one has gone: 'Was it difficult to have an omniscient protagonist?'
You have- It's so hard!
#### JONNY
Real difficult.
#### ALEX
Even then we still have to rely on the crutch of, like, a couple of blind spots.
#### JONNY
The time we spent working out the exact shape and limits of these blind spots,
because we had to have them, because otherwise, like, you can't have any reveals.
#### ALEX
It was the same for Elias where we were doing it right back when, going, 'We have
a problem, which is if we have a truly omniscient antagonist here, it's impossible to
win.'
We had to, yeah, create those blind spots and so on. And the distraction elements
and blah, blah, blah. But this one tied to that as well is, we really wanted to have,
basically the evil superpower thing of- that was more interesting than just, I can
read your thoughts. Because again, if you have omniscience and can do complete
mind reading, what's the point?
And I really liked the idea of weaponising memories against people. It's horrible,
but I did like it. It came together well.
#### JONNY
I'm very proud of how Elias ended up as a, like, practical feature of the plots, if
that makes sense. And, like, a lot of it always came down to this thing of, like, well,
he can see realistically almost anything because there are pictures of eyes, basically
everywhere. But he's still one person who is at any given point going to be looking
in one place, in a direction, and often out of his own eyes.
#### ALEX
How retro!
#### JONNY
Yeah, like, classic.
#### ALEX
I was going to say, “out of his own eyes”, technically, yes, always.
#### JONNY
They are his own eyes. I was very careful when I said that.
#### ALEX
It is odd, once you look at the series as a whole, to think of like the elements that
are there, where it's like, 'His body is just still down there. Chillin'-
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
'-through all of this, just... just having a grand old time, waiting.' It's odd.
#### JONNY
Yeah, keeping his body down there was something like, kind of new. That was
something that actually came quite late. I think I'd originally just conceived of it as,
like, a body hopping thing. But then I was like, 'No, there needs to be something in
the Panopticon that, like, is a vulnerability.'
#### ALEX
Thank goodness we had the mechanism that the tunnels steered people away.
Otherwise Martin's first foray is:
- 'I went down in the tunnels.'
- 'What'd you find?'
- 'The end of the series, mate. It was just laid out.'
#### JONNY
Yeah,
#### ALEX
'I found Jurgen Leitner, Gertrude Robinson's body, the Panopticon, you know, the
list goes on, like, I've basically solved it in a single journey.'
#### JONNY
It is three different series finales, which revolve around the revelation of something
in-
#### ALEX
And that's not including the fact that he found Gertrude Robinson's, like, arch,
first failed thing.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
There's a version where Martin just goes in the tunnel, solves everything and
leaves.
#### JONNY
Well, I mean, I guess, like, it does make sense in the fact that like so much of it is
about the Institute and what is lurking in the Institute's past, which metaphorically
is represented by the tunnels.
#### ALEX
It's like that bit in the Marvel films where they're like, 'Oh look, all of the stones
are in one place, at one time.' A lot of our plot was just chilling in the tunnels until
it was needed.

#### “[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
##### [GERTRUDE GROANS]
GERTRUDE: (Adopts a somewhat frailer voice) Hello?
##### [DOOR OPENS]
MICHAEL: Ah, Miss Robinson, I, um, I found Mr. Vargas' statement that you
asked for. Well, uh, I found the translation. I, I already had the original but,
y'know, I, I, I didn't think you'd want it in Spanish. [Nervous chuckles] U-UUnless you speak Spanish?
GERTRUDE: (Somewhat sharply) I do not. And thank you Michael.
MICHAEL: Sure. Um, well, was, was there anything else you needed?
GERTRUDE: Um... No, no. Not at the moment.
Thank you.
MICHAEL: Right, well, if you need me, uh, they're installing that climatecontrolled storage... that thing o-o-over the weekend, so I'm, I'm, y'know, I'm just
getting all that together.
GERTRUDE: Yes! Yes, I remember.
MICHAEL: Right.
Well, call me if you need anything.
GERTRUDE: Thank you, Michael, I will.”
#### JONNY
Ahhh... Another little bit of Luke, this time being lovely.
#### ALEX
That laugh. Just that subtle...
#### JONNY
What a nice scene, between two conscientious workers.
#### ALEX
It's just the hard, cold turn of 'Yeah. Alright. And now I'm back into full blown
mode.'
Michael is played by Luke Booys. And, I think I remember at the time, because
obviously we had Michael the monster prior to Michael the assistant. So as a result,
we were working backwards from monster.
#### JONNY
It was, as I recall, a lot harder to get Luke to zone in on the 'not creepy'. When we
explained the character to him, when he turned up to just stab the Archivist, he
was just, like, 'Boom! [SNAPS FINGERS] Yep. Okay. I can do this weird
monster.' Then we had to, like, take what would be like, 'No, this is- he's just-
he thinks that this is a harmless old lady that he's working for. And, you know, he's
just being very gentle.'
#### ALEX
There's a trick with Luke that he really keys into, which is providing a parallel
example. I don't think I've ever mentioned this on audio before. The example that
he was given to play towards was, I think it's called The Man With Thistledown
Hair from [Jonathan] Strange & [Mr] Norrell.
#### JONNY
I never actually read Doctor Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell.
#### ALEX
Doctor Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, there was a BBC, I think it is, adaptation as
well, and it had a very good portrayal of, basically a fae trickster, effectively. And I
honestly, I think at some point said, 'Have you seen this? Can you channel that
energy?' at which point Luke goes, 'Oh yeah! Okay. Yeah, I got you covered.
Great. Here you go.' And then just clicked in.
And I remember for this one, when he was playing Michael the assistant, he had at
that point been aware of some of the stuff I'd done as Martin. And I went, 'Could
you just do Martin, please?'
#### JONNY
(Laughing) 'Could you just be Martin?'
Okay. What we got next?
##### [CLIP: MAG101 -- Another Twist ]

#### JONNY
Everyone loves Michael.
It's Michael's demise.
#### ALEX
Ohhh, yeah!
Oh yeah, “it's locked”, that was lovely. I loved that so much.
#### JONNY
Oh, here it comes.
#### ALEX
(Wincing) Oh, that's so loud.
#### JONNY
Yep.
And here... Is Helen!
#### ALEX
Hey Imogen.
Oh, of course! And I forgot that right when Helen's first introduced, Helen's very
cold and flat.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
And yeah, that was a whole thing, wasn't it? Where Helen slowly gets more and
more affable and joyously trickstery, but at the start she's so patted down.
#### JONNY
Yeah. It's all so new and, like, unvarnished in lot of ways.
#### ALEX
Yeah, I agonised-
#### JONNY
That was a good joke, by the way, there, Alex. In case you missed it.
#### ALEX
No, it's pretty good .No, I appreciated it. It was certainly a 'portal to humour'.
#### JONNY
(Deadpan) I don't understand.
#### ALEX
You're the worst, just... oh god.
#### JONNY
I'm just remembering how many times you got me to do the line “Well you try it”,
because I wasn't being sufficiently petulant.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah. Cos that's the thing is, there was a golden period with the Archivist
where it's like, 'More petulant. More, more petulant. More, more! It needs to be
ridiculous.' I genuinely spent, I hesitate to think how many hours, on just that
scream and combo alone.
#### JONNY
Oh yeah, I can imagine.
#### ALEX
Like hours and hours, because again, it's early enough that I didn't have certain
procedures down pat, and there still wasn't huge amounts of help and things like
that. You know, when you get a bee in your bonnet and you know exactly how it
needs to sound.
#### JONNY
Speaking of, actually, is it too late to redo it? Just cos I was listening to it right
there...
#### ALEX
No. I am confident. I am confident that I have spent enough time that that's as
good as it gets. That is as good as it gets. There are very few moments in this series
where I am confident in what has been achieved. That is one of them. And I know
because I lost-
#### JONNY
That such a sad thing to say.
#### ALEX
I lost a lot of sleep on it.
##### [CLIP: MAG102 -- Nesting Instinct]
“François Deschamps has refused our request for a follow-up interview. He did
forward us one item, however. [Snorts] I can't read the French on this one, but it
appears to be a crudely printed wedding invitation. Benoît Maçon is the only name
legible on it, as most of the details are obscured by a wide variety of dried stains.
Most helpful of all, though, is the simple fact that Gertrude was in Toulouse in
June 2014. The information I found from her laptop doesn't give a complete
picture of her travels, but now I know when to look, and it appears that when she
left Toulouse she did not return to London. Instead, it looks like she took several
connecting flights, eventually ending up in Wellington International Airport in
New Zealand.”
#### JONNY
It's Beetle.
I think this is Beetle-man?
#### ALEX
I don't remember.
#### JONNY
Yeah, man who marries a beetle!
#### ALEX
Oh gosh, yeah! Or 'Jonny does Kafka' is what I always thought of it in my head.
#### JONNY
What? No. This is straight romance, Alex.
#### ALEX
No, I know. But my problem is, is that I do the connection -- Beetle to
Metamorphosis to Kafka story. So as a result, I always connected it in my head.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
I like this one. It was so weird in the best way possible. I really liked this one.
#### JONNY
This is in the same arc as Monster Pig. There's a point in Season 3 where I really
am enjoying trying to, like, see how far I can push 'weird' in a way that, like,
straddles the line between funny and horrifying, and hopefully keeps it mostly into
horrifying, but still also definitely, like, quite funny because it is, like, how would I
take the idea of this man is in love with a beetle and make it kind of horrifying.
Especially, like, in terms of how The Corruption works as a power
#### ALEX
Checking, what's the scene that comes after?
#### JONNY
Oh, this is just after the Archivist's returned from his fun skincare vacation, his spa
month. You know, Martin missed the Archivist, the Archivist missed Martin, I
guess maybe this is, like, a point that, sort of, is starting-
#### ALEX
Starting to cement stuff?
#### JONNY
-that relationship and, like, properly establish it.
But, moreover, a man is in love with a beetle.
#### ALEX
I mean, was that an intentional parallel that you had? 'I am in love with a beetle.
And then Martin turns up'?
#### JONNY
I did just think actually. I was like, 'A man is in love with a beetle and his name is
Martin.'
No, that was not an intentional parallel. This is one of those periods where the
exact statement- I think the statements actually got shuffled around a little bit
between episodes, because, like, it was one where there was a lot of plot, going
specific places. There were certain statements that needed to be at certain points.
But yeah, there were certainly- I don't think they were initially written as the same
episode, but I could be wrong.
#### ALEX
You went through that period where you started to divorce the statements a little
bit in certain chunks from what was happening, so that you could do that, I
remember.
#### JONNY
Yeah. And there were some that needed to be in certain locations or matching
certain plot beats, but there were others that were a bit more free-floating.
#### ALEX
Sorry. It's just odd listening to you and me talking, and then talking over you and
me talking.
#### JONNY
Yeah, it does- It is a bit disconcerting.
#### ALEX
It's pretty much a summary of my life at this point.
#### JONNY
I mean... yeah. Well, no, I mean, you know, not so much now. Not so much now.
#### ALEX
Ahhh, ahhh.

knows what that was, it's you.”

Good ol' Jon Gracey.

That was so much fun to record.
#### JONNY
I don't even know if I'd call it “fun”. It was just, like, sometimes you'll get a
recording and it just flows.
#### ALEX
Yeah, it was so easy.
#### JONNY
I recall just doing three takes. Boom, boom, boom.
#### ALEX
It was lovely. You both just walked in, 'Do this. Alright. Okay, we'll do it two more
times. Why? In case it might break. Ah, okay.'
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
'How have you been?' Like, it was just lovely, straightforward. Really, really nice
recording.
#### JONNY
Jon absolutely nailed the part. I feel- You know those things where it's like, 'Oh
yeah, no, we've got the casting really good on that'? And, like, you feel like kind of
a pay-off on that in the studio. Cos you're like, 'Yes. Really thought that this
person would absolutely nail the part. And they did.'
#### ALEX
I love the weariness, but not- it's not true sadness. It's not 'Woe is me'.
#### JONNY
He's not cynical, is Gerry, is the thing.
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### JONNY
He still, kind of, believes in the possibility of goodness, even though he himself has,
like, seen pretty much only dreadful stuff for most of his life.
#### ALEX
Yeah. This is someone who's read about goodness and has 'I'm sure it's out there
somewhere'.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
As a sequence as well, I loved you were encountering Gerry out in a North
American shack. It was not the person anyone expected you to be meeting on your
foreign sojourn.
#### JONNY
Mmm. It's a lovely episode for me retrospectively because it's one that I feel very,
like, 'vindicated' is not quite the right word, but like, I feel that exposition-heavy
lore dumps are ridiculously difficult to not make super-boring.
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### JONNY
And in retrospect, 111? We nailed it.
#### ALEX
I also really like the, sort of, the almost attempt at, like, ransom that Gerry does, if
you remember.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
Where Gerry's like, 'Maybe I won't tell you.' It's like,
- 'Well, what've you got to lose?'
- 'What do I have to gain?'
- '[GROANS] Just give me some lore.'
#### JONNY
Yeah, it's taking the lore dump and wrapping it in a really, actually interesting and
fun, new character dynamic.
#### ALEX
Yeah. I really liked that dynamic. It's one of the ones where, to be clear, there was
just no versions of The Magnus Archives where that dynamic could be, you know,
explored extensively and still really work, but it's one of the dynamics where, if
there could have been, I really would have liked there to have been.
#### JONNY
I mean, it is the thing that dynamic only works so well because of the stuff that
means that it could only ever happen in a single scene.
#### ALEX
I mean, could you imagine it? The Archivist and Gerry, it's got such a Randall and
Hopkirk, Deceased vibe.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
Going around, solving crimes, one of you's a ghost.
#### JONNY
One of the reasons it works so well is because of Gerry's role within the wider
world and the wider narrative, but that also very much puts a limit, I guess, on how
much he can actually be there.
Good scene, I think.
#### ALEX
Well on that then, I hope this has been an enlightening experience for everyone.
#### JONNY
Yes.
#### ALEX
Mostly that it's better to listen to it without a pair of people just-
#### JONNY
Nattering about.
#### ALEX
-nattering through the whole way, so you can't hear what's going on.
#### JONNY
(Nasal voice) I think that the thing we did in this episode was good.
#### ALEX
(Playing along) I disagree. Discuss.
#### JONNY
(Nasal voice) I really enjoyed working with all of the actors except for my mother.
#### ALEX
Right. Okay. I am going to wrap this episode up here.
#### JONNY
If you listen to this, Mother, I did enjoy working with you.
#### ALEX
Right. Okay. In that case then, thanks everyone. I think we'll be back next week
with some different content, but until then, thanks everyone and look after
yourselves.
#### JONNY
Bye!
#### ALEX
Bye!
