[Show Theme -- Intro]
#### EXT. BEACH OF A SMALL ISLAND IN THE INDIAN OCEAN. MORNING.
A few moments of this peace. And then:
#### ALESTES
#### COME ON, YOU MISERABLE WORMS, GET UP. HONESTLY, YOU HAUL ONE LITTLE BOAT
to shore...
#### NOOR
It was heavy, Captain.
#### SIVA
I think I've dislocated my shoulder.
#### INEZ
I can taste my own teeth.
#### ALESTES
Now -- "what are we doing on this shallow spit of land with nary a convenient
mooring spot in sight?" I hear you ask.
#### INEZ
Developing a hernia?
#### ALESTES
My crew! Nay -- my friends --
#### INEZ
Susmaryosep... [portmanteau of Jesus Mary Joseph with the meaning 'give me
strength']
#### ALESTES
The day has come. The day me, and you -- but mostly me -- have long dreamed
of. For I have procured something very special indeed -- two somethings, in fact.
Two very special somethings that will lead us... to TREASURE.
With a flourish, she produces two items from under her cloak. There is a
lengthy silence.
#### SIVA
Are those...sea turtles?
#### NOOR
I find your sense of humour perplexing at times, Captain --
#### ALESTES
It's not a joke! These are treasure-finding turtles.
Beat.
#### INEZ
Noor, you pin her arms down -- Siva, look around for some vines or something-
#### ALESTES
[talking over him]
Using turtles to find treasure is a long and storied tradition amongst folk who
sail under... certain flags.
#### SIVA
Pirates! She means pirates!
#### ALESTES
It is said --
#### SIVA
Because she used to be a pirate.
#### ALESTES
It is said that a pair of mating turtles, fed a tiny nugget of treasure, will settle at
the spot where gold is laid.
#### SIVA
Aw. Quite romantic, really.
#### NOOR
But if what you say is true -- how is it that every sea from here to the Caribbean
has not been fished dry of turtles?
#### ALESTES
You can't just use any old turtle.
#### NOOR
No?
#### ALESTES
No. They have to be bonded, heart and soul, with the person who raised them.
#### NOOR
#### ...ABOUT THOSE VINES --
#### ALESTES
Two turtles fed with a tiny piece of gold on a pirate captain's lap will lead you to
treasure, I've seen it!
#### SIVA
You've... seen it?
#### ALESTES
Saw the gold come out of the ground, plain as day. Glittering like a better
tomorrow.
#### SIVA
Well... I... suppose it's not... inconceivable that certain species of chelonioidea
might develop sensitivity to... certain metals.
#### NOOR
Stranger things have occurred in nature... salmon return to their native waters
to spawn... dung beetles follow the path of the Milky Way... it could be
scientifically... Inez?
#### INEZ
I think it's bollocks.
#### ALESTES
Too bad I'm not giving anyone a choice. Let's split into two teams and take a
turtle each, I suggest --
#### SIVA
I'll go with Noor!
#### ALESTES
Right then. I suppose that leaves me and...
#### INEZ
I'm not digging.
(leaving, calling back)
And I'm not talking to a turtle either!
Ooh, there had better be gold.
#### EXT. JUNGLE OF THE SAME SMALL ISLAND. MORNING.
#### SIVA
#### ...AND THEN I'LL BUY A COMPLETE SET OF ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA -- YOU KNOW IT'S
nearly twenty volumes now? I must confess, I do have a modest little daydream
of one day contributing something to it myself, so I think owning it is a wise
first step. That is, of course, if there's room for it in our house --
#### NOOR
"Our" house?
#### SIVA
You, me, Alestes, Inez and Baker! We'll find a little cottage somewhere --
#### NOOR
Siva. If we really do find treasure, do you imagine Alestes will want to set eyes
on any of us again?
#### SIVA
Oh. Well. No... no, of course, I suppose... but you and I could He stops abruptly, embarrassed. Sticky insect hum.
#### NOOR
It hardly matters. You know as well as I do that this plan is... dubious, to say the
least.
#### SIVA
Oh but imagine, Noor! Imagine that we find the gold -- what would you do with
your share?
My guess is that you would buy yourself a boat and go sailing every day across
the islands, and then in the evening bring back all manner of fascinating flora
and fauna-
#### NOOR
Back to "our" house?
#### SIVA
Well... yes. If -- if you want...
#### NOOR
Siva... you know I -- I value your company but...
#### SIVA
Look! Snails!
#### NOOR
Ay. That boy.
#### SIVA
These will make a fine addition to my collection! Do you see? Much smaller
shells than the Architectonica -- from my reading, I believe them to be of the
genus helicarionidae -- of course I shan't know for certain until I'm back on the
ship and can verify it in Mr Blair's book -- the most interesting thing about this
family is their use of "love darts" during their courtships --
#### NOOR
You better go now!
#### SIVA
#### ... GO WHERE?
#### NOOR
Back to the ship. To verify the snails.
#### SIVA
But -- we're supposed to --
#### NOOR
#### I AM CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT THIS WILD GOOSE CHASE ON MY OWN. I'M SURE YOU
could make better use of your time elsewhere.
#### SIVA
But I don't mind --
#### NOOR
Siva, just go!
#### SIVA
Yes. I see. Yes. I will -- take my leave.
#### [SIVA LEAVES]
#### NOOR
Oh, Allah. Give me strength.
#### EXT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND. NOON.
#### [ALESTES AND INEZ DIGGING]
#### INEZ
Anything?
#### ALESTES
Not yet.
#### INEZ
QuŽ sorpresa.
#### ALESTES
Look, it's here, alright? We just haven't... found it yet.
#### INEZ
You'd be better off letting me have those turtles for my collection.
#### ALESTES
You're not butchering them, Inez.
#### INEZ
Conserving. I conserve animals.
#### ALESTES
Either way, you're not having them.
#### INEZ
What makes you so certain there's treasure on this island anyway?
Alestes. Whose treasure are we looking for?
#### ALESTES
(mumbles)
Gammon.
#### INEZ
What?
#### ALESTES
Gammon! Alright? We're looking for Gammon's treasure, which is definitely on
this island.
#### INEZ
Of all the...
#### ALESTES
Now, before you go off on one --
#### INEZ
I don't know which stupidity to be angry at first! The fact that this is an obvious
trap! Or the fact that if we did by some oblique chance find treasure belonging
to a man nicknamed "Gammon", you'd be painting a target on our backs so
wide it could be seen from the moon!
#### ALESTES
It's here! And when we find it, we'll have enough riches to retire to a beach on
the other side of the world before he knows it!
#### INEZ
I can't believe you would be so stupid as to trust --
#### ALESTES
You don't know him!
#### INEZ
Just misunderstood, is he?
#### ALESTES
No, he's a rotten sack of potato mould masquerading as a man, but that's not
the point! ...he likes me.
#### INEZ
He likes you?
#### ALESTES
You wouldn't understand.
#### INEZ
It's not me that has trouble comprehending human emotion, "Captain".
#### ALESTES
Ha! I've yet to hear a single personal fact about yourself! Siva's always going on
about his Nani, even Noor tells stories about Aden, but you -- you seem to have
sprung fully formed out of a pit of bile with no human attachment whatsoever!
#### INEZ
You know nothing about my family.
#### ALESTES
Go on then, what did the illustrious de Lunas do to fail to live up to your
impossible standards?
#### INEZ
My impossible standards? You expect us to work every hour of the day while
constantly endangering our lives; not lifting a finger to help!
#### ALESTES
Misdirection!
#### INEZ
You know what? I will tell you one thing about my past: I thought my last
master was the worst I could ever have. I was wrong.
#### ALESTES
This is pointless. It must be further inland.
#### INT. THE GALLEY OF THE NETA. MIDDAY.
#### SIVA
Sorry, sorry! Didn't mean to intrude.
#### BAKER
No intrusion. I'm just writing.
#### SIVA
I'll just go to my bunk and...
#### BAKER
Anything you'd like to talk about, Siva?
#### SIVA
No, no, I'll let you get on...
#### BAKER
Are you sure? Because I can --
#### SIVA
Well, it's Noor! I don't understand it, really I don't -- I try and try, I bring them
things, and they seem to like my company but then as soon as I press the point
in any way they stop talking and tell me to go and do something else! I would
be distraught to learn I was causing them any kind of discomfort and much of
the time that does not seem to be the case but then they simply clam up out of
nowhere and I... I don't know what to do.
#### BAKER
A heavy matter indeed. Unrequited love.
#### SIVA
Well, I -- I don't know about love exactly, certainly I admire them --
#### BAKER
But they... don't always respond how you'd like?
#### SIVA
That's exactly it.
(sighs)
I'm at my wit's end. I'll just have to try something else. If only they would tell
me what they want...
#### BAKER
You know, I've been to a lot of places, and I hope to go many more before I pass
on. But one thing has remained the same no matter where I travelled: people
rarely say exactly what they want.
#### SIVA
But it would be so much easier if they did.
#### BAKER
Of course. How can I explain?
Ah -- who do you think I'm writing to?
#### SIVA
#### I -- DON'T KNOW. I SUPPOSE I'VE NEVER CONSIDERED THAT OUR CREW MIGHT HAVE
attachments outside of the ship.
#### BAKER
I'm writing to my husband.
#### SIVA
Your -- husband?
#### BAKER
Gabe. He's very far away from where we are -- he lives on land. Mi'kma'ki although I suppose you might know it by the name Nova Scotia.
#### SIVA
You have a husband in the Province of Canada?
#### BAKER
I do.
#### SIVA
But you've never mentioned him!
#### BAKER
Sometimes we protect the things closest to our heart by not talking about
them.
#### SIVA
#### ...DO YOU MISS HIM?
#### BAKER
More than anything.
#### SIVA
And... doesn't he miss you?
#### BAKER
Oh yes.
#### SIVA
Then why are you apart? If I was lucky enough to be with the one I loved...
#### BAKER
Because people are complicated. And we don't always say what we want...
#### EXT. MI'KMA'KI. OUTSIDE GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.
#### [GABE SINGING TO HIMSELF, THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR]
#### GABE
What in the world -- ?
It's open!
#### BAKER
Gabe.
#### GABE
Baker?
#### BAKER
There wasn't time to send word --
#### GABE
I thought you were...
But you're fine. What do you want?
#### BAKER
#### I -- I DIDN'T COME BACK FOR ME.
#### GABE
Of course not. Why would you?
#### [BAKER REVEALS NDILISWA]
#### BAKER
#### ...SHE NEEDS HELP.
#### GABE
And who is "she"?
#### BAKER
She --
#### GABE
The child can speak for herself.
#### BAKER
No. She can't. Or... won't. That's the problem.
#### ... PUT HER IN MY BED. YOU REMEMBER WHERE IT IS.
#### [BAKER TAKES NDILISWA TO THE OTHER ROOM AND RETURNS ALONE]
#### BAKER
She's out. Exhausted after the journey we had.
#### GABE
She looks like she's been through a heap of something.
#### BAKER
Hasn't said a word since I found her half drowned off the coast of Jamaica.
Barely eats. It's like she's living but she's not...
#### GABE
Alive.
#### ...WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, BAKER?
There's a hundred spots between here and Jamaica you could have chosen to
rest up.
#### BAKER
#### ...I COULDN'T... GIVE HER WHAT SHE NEEDED. AND I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU...
#### I MISSED YOU.
#### GABE
I thought you were dead.
#### BAKER
I'm sorry.
#### GABE
Five years.
#### BAKER
I'm sorry.
#### GABE
Five years and not a word!
#### BAKER
I'm --
#### GABE
If you say "sorry" again, I'll turn you out of the house right now!
#### BAKER
#### I... YES.
#### GABE BREATHES DEEPLY.
#### GABE
You know, I wasn't happy about you going, but I would have understood. I
could see you needed to be... somewhere else.
(beat)
Why didn't you talk to me?
#### BAKER
Didn't know what to say.
#### GABE
Well then. Guess there's not much to say now, is there?
You can sleep on the floor. I'll make up a bed.
#### BAKER
Gabe, please --
#### GABE
We can talk about what to do with this girl of yours in the morning. In the
meantime, you'd better have a good hard think.
#### BAKER
About what?
#### GABE
How long you intend to stay.
#### 6. INT. MI'KMA'KI. GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.
#### GABE
That girl! She'll be the death of me! Or more likely -- someone else.
#### BAKER
She didn't mean to --
#### GABE
She can speak for herself, thank you. Now -- Alestes. What have you got to say?
#### ALESTES
(sulky, teenage)
He was being stupid.
#### GABE
There are plenty of stupid people in the world, Alestes, we don't go holding
their heads underwater!
#### ALESTES
Why not? It's the quickest way.
#### GABE
To do what?
#### ALESTES
To stop them from being stupid again.
#### GABE
[trying not to laugh] You'll apologise and bring the boy's family a gift. Some of
that salmon we smoked last week should do it.
#### ALESTES
But WHY?
#### GABE
Because other people are all we have. We look after our neighbours, and they
look after us.
#### ALESTES
But I don't need looking after. I can take care of myself just fine.
#### GABE
Of course you can, Alestes. Nobody doubts how strong you are. How capable.
But isn't it nice, sometimes, to have someone dote on you? To teach you how
to smoke salmon, or to tell you stories?
#### ALESTES
#### ... I'D RATHER BE MAKING STORIES.
#### GABE
Oh yeah? Going to be an adventurer like my sweet seafarer?
#### [GABE GIVES BAKER AN OTT PARENTAL KISS]
#### ALESTES
Ughh!
Fine!! I'll go apologise, will that make you stop?!!
#### BAKER
#### ...SHOULD WE BE WORRIED, GABE? TALKING LIKE THAT...
#### GABE
She'll be fine. She'll find the right place for herself. In time.
#### INT. MI'KMA'KI. GABE AND BAKER'S HOUSE. THE PAST.
#### BAKER
#### ...TEN -- NO, FIFTEEN FOOT HIGH AT LEAST! WE SAW THE WAVE COMING OFF THE STARBOARD
bow and we were powerless to stop it -- I tell you, you don't know the sea --
#### GABE/ALESTES
[chorusing together]
#### ...UNTIL SHE'S SHOWED YOU THE BACK OF HER HAND.
[they laugh]
#### BAKER
Told this one before, have I?
#### ALESTES
Only every time there's a storm.
#### BAKER
Well, that's the trouble with coming inland. You stop making new stories to tell.
#### ALESTES
Do you think I'll ever get to make stories like yours?
#### BAKER
If that's what you...
#### GABE
I think we should all be making stories by going to bed and dreaming. Off you
go, Alestes.
#### [ALESTES STARTS TO LEAVE]
#### GABE
And no reading into the small hours!
#### ALESTES
'Course not, Gabe. Night, Baker.
#### [ALESTES LEAVES]
#### BAKER
What's she reading now?
#### GABE
Tales of the Deep. You know -- sea monsters, pirate ships...
#### BAKER
I promise I didn't give it to her --
#### GABE
No, no. She picked it up in Halifax all by herself.
She's... old enough to do a lot of things by herself now. ...Not much younger
than us when we met.
#### BAKER
That's different.
#### GABE
How?
#### BAKER
She's been through a lot, she --
#### GABE
She'll never put what she's been though behind her if she doesn't go out and
start seeing the world herself.
#### BAKER
What are you saying?
#### GABE
You know as well as I do that she won't stay here hunting squid and squirrels
her whole life.
#### BAKER
She can't go out there on her own.
#### GABE
I know. ...That's why you're going with her.
#### BAKER
Gabe, no.
#### GABE
Don't look at me like that. It's been -- more than I can say, having you both here
with me. But I've seen the way your eyes sparkle when you're telling your old
stories. I know she's not the only one that wants the chance to make more.
Am I wrong?
#### BAKER
#### ...I CAN'T ABANDON YOU AGAIN.
#### GABE
So this time it won't be an abandonment. You're going to take our girl into the
world and show her what there is to be seen. And then -- you're going to sit
down and write to me about it.
#### BAKER
Write?
#### GABE
Why do you think I spent so much time teaching you your letters? Not for my
health, I can tell you that.
#### BAKER
You said I was improving!
#### GABE
And you're going to improve more by writing to me! Once a month, at least,
and I want to know everything -- where you go, what you eat... how many boys
Alestes beats up along the way...
#### BAKER
You had this all planned out.
#### GABE
Baby, the moment you stepped back in my home, I knew it wouldn't be forever.
And that's alright. You need to be out there, same as I need to be here, with my
school and my people. Just -- don't forget this time.
#### BAKER
Forget what?
#### GABE
That there are people here who love you. That this is home.
#### BAKER
Gabe...
#### GABE
Shush now. We've still got tonight at least...
#### INT. THE GALLEY OF THE NETA. AFTERNOON.
#### SIVA
#### ...HOW LONG SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HIM?
#### BAKER
Going on a few years now.
#### SIVA
A few years?
#### BAKER
I keep my promise. One letter a month, sometimes more.
#### SIVA
And that's enough?
#### BAKER
People are complicated, Siva. We need things that... don't always make sense.
#### SIVA
I see. Or rather, I don't see and I'm not sure I ever will, but -- yes, I see.
#### BAKER
Come here, lad.
#### [BAKER PULLS SIVA INTO A BIG HUG.]
#### SIVA
Thank you Baker!
#### BAKER
Now -- pass me that rice. Coming up on dinner time.
####  EXT. THE ISLAND. APPROACHING DUSK.
#### [ALESTES AND INEZ DIGGING AS BEFORE, SLOWER NOW]
#### INEZ
Touch of pink on the horizon.
#### ALESTES
Talking about the weather now, are we? Fascinating.
#### INEZ
I'm saying it'll be dark within the hour. We should get back to the ship.
#### ALESTES
Not stopping now.
#### [INEZ THROWS DOWN THEIR SHOVEL]
#### INEZ
Oh, give UP, Alestes. We've dug holes all over this godforsaken rock and we've
found exactly nothing. There isn't any treasure. There isn't any gold. He was
toying with you.
#### ALESTES
No. There has to be.
#### INEZ
#### WHY DOES THERE HAVE TO BE?
Because he promised you?
#### ALESTES
Because IBecause I sold something important to him. The second we struck gold I was
going to go back and exchange them.
#### INEZ
What did you give him?
#### ALESTES
None of your[lying]
#### ... NOOR'S BRACELETS.
#### INEZ
How desperate are you?
#### ALESTES
What?
#### INEZ
Anyone with half a brain could see that this plan had more holes in it than one
of your pathetic fishing nets, yet you're so desperate to believe you can get
lucky on some half-cocked fairy tale about sea turtles that you gamble away
your crewmate's possessions?
I've had enough. I'm going to find Noor and Siva and we're going to row back to
the ship.
#### ALESTES
Fine, go. I'm not stoping until-
#### [CLUNK! METAL HITTING SOMETHING BIG AND HEAVY AND WOODEN]
#### INEZ
What was that?
#### ALESTES
I think -- I think --
#### INEZ
Was that -- ?
#### ALESTES
Don't just stand there! Pick up your shovel and dig!
#### [INEZ AND ALESTES DIG]
#### ALESTES
Yes, yes, get it out -- carefully...
#### INEZ
You be careful.
#### ALESTES
That's it Oh my god.
#### INEZ
Oh my god.
#### ALESTES
It's real.
#### INEZ
I can't believe it.
#### ALESTES
I knew it was real! I knew that old goat would never lie to me!
#### [ALESTES LIFTS THE LID]
#### INEZ
What?
What is it?
#### ALESTES
No.
#### INEZ
What's in there? Let me see.
#### ALESTES
I don't -- it's not --
#### [INEZ LIFTS OUT A PIECE OF PAPER]
#### INEZ
It's just.. a note. Nothing else.
(reading)
"Better luck next time, kid. Love Gammon. Kiss."
#### ALESTES
#### I... HE...
#### INEZ
It was a trick.
#### ALESTES
He lied.
#### INEZ
Just a dirty, rotten trick!
#### ALESTES
He said -- he said --
#### INEZ
He said there was treasure!
#### ALESTES
And I believed him! I believed him.
What are you looking at?
#### INEZ
Nothing.
#### ALESTES
Go on then, fill your boots. Say "I told you so". Run off and spread the word
that Alestes of the Netaonasom is the worst captain to sail the seven seas: a
dupe, a fool, a naive idiot with gold in her eyes-
#### INEZ
#### ...I DON'T RECKON THERE'S ANYTHING I COULD SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT SAYING TO YOURSELF.
#### ALESTES
We should get back. Baker wanted us to stop in at port on the way, check for
letters.
#### INEZ
Are you... alright?
#### ALESTES
Nothing the sight of Gammon's blood on my sword won't fix.
####  INT. THE GALLEY OF THE NETA. EVENING.
#### BAKER
Just in time! Food's on the table.
Any luck?
#### [ALESTES GRUNTS NO. SHE THUNKS THE TWO (DEAD) TURTLES ON THE TABLE]
#### ALESTES
These are for the pot.
#### SIVA
Are those the turtles?
#### INEZ
I want those shells once you're done with them.
#### BAKER
Right. Of course.
#### INEZ
We came back via port as you asked.
#### BAKER
Anything for me?
#### SIVA
Oh, you mean -- !
You mean any... interesting... messages...
#### NOOR
Nothing for you, Baker. But Siva -- something for you.
#### SIVA
What? Who could possibly -- what? Why are you smiling?
#### NOOR
Why don't you take a look?
#### SIVA
It's from... Mr Blair. He says... he says... my goodness.
#### BAKER
Don't leave us in suspense, lad!
#### SIVA
He says he might have found a position for me at the Queen's Museum.
#### BAKER
Siva, that's wonderful!
#### NOOR
Isn't it! I hope you don't mind, the note wasn't sealed and Inez saw Mr Blair's
signature so we snuck a peak and -- Mashallah! I'm so delighted for you!
#### INEZ
The Queen's Museum! That's not to be sniffed at.
#### SIVA
#### ...IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE...
#### INEZ
Then what's with the expression?
#### NOOR
It's the opportunity of a lifetime, Siva.
#### SIVA
Yes, I -- suppose it might be.
Alest -- captain. Could we make port at Kalitivu? Mr Blair says I can leave word
of my response for him there.
#### ALESTES
Headed that way anyway.
Congratulations.
#### BAKER
Are you sure nothing's wrong?
#### ALESTES
Not now, Baker.
#### BAKER
#### I TAKE IT TODAY WASN'T -- EVERYTHING YOU HOPED.
#### ALESTES
We need to alter course for Kalitivu.
#### BAKER
Of course. Good of you to do that for Siva.
#### ALESTES
Siva's news wasn't the only message waiting for us at port.
#### BAKER
Anh...?
#### ALESTES
Yes. My favour has come due.
