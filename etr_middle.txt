#### CHIOMA
Hello! And welcome to this Magnus Archives special episode, where we find out how
well Jonathan Sims and Alexander J Newall know the world that they've created.
I'm Chioma Nwalioba and I play Annabelle Cane in the series. And I have in front
of me a selection of questions from a quiz, which was run for the Magnus wrap
livestream on Twitch.
Let's jump straight in, shall we, with Season 1 and start putting them through their
paces.
##### [EERIE TRANSITION]
What is the name of the first episode of The Magnus Archives?
#### ALEX
Ah, hello! Yes! I know that one.
#### JONNY
(Deadpan) Yes, it is: 'Good Morning, Mr. Scary'.
#### ALEX
Well, now here's the question... this is me immediately attacking the terms. Are
they counting trailers? And teasers?
#### JONNY
Whaaaaaaatt?!
#### ALEX
Because the first episode of The Magnus Archives is of course Anglerfish. However,
there was the teaser. So what do we think, Jonny?
#### JONNY
But they weren't titled.
#### ALEX
They weren't titled, it was just 'Teaser'. I'm going to reserve the right to give two
answers, which is 'Teaser', if someone's playing, you know, tricksie, or Anglerfish, if
it's the actual answer.
Do you, do you concur, Jonny?
#### JONNY
I do concur.
#### CHIOMA
The answer to that, of course, is Anglerfish
##### [TRIUMPHANT NOISES FROM JONNY AND ALEX]
What was the name of the second voice to ever appear on tape in The Magnus
Archives?
#### ALEX
The name of the second voice...
#### JONNY
I remember it was 13, it was Alone.
#### ALEX
If it was 13, it was Alone... I think it would be Katie Davison.
#### JONNY
That sounds right.
#### ALEX
Was there not an appearance before then?
#### JONNY
No.
#### ALEX
When's Lost Johns' Cave?
#### JONNY
No, Lost Johns' Cave is number 15.
#### ALEX
Oh, so that's after...
#### JONNY
13, I believe, is the first time you hear a second voice.
#### ALEX
Hmm. I think it's Katie Davison, but I feel like I'm already—
#### JONNY
Cool.
#### ALEX
—I'm already starting to expose how little attention I pay to our own projects.
#### JONNY
I'm going to back up Alex's answer here, and say it's definitely Katie Davison.
#### ALEX
##### [UNSURE NOISES] Go on.
#### CHIOMA
Well done! The answer is Katie Davison as Naomi Hearne.
#### JONNY
Yay!
#### ALEX
Yes! YES! I'm not a bad person! Yes!
#### CHIOMA
Later in the series, John takes an axe to a certain suspicious and mesmerising table.
In which episode did this table first make an appearance?
#### JONNY
Pretty sure they're referring to the sound desk, Big Bertha, so...
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
When did we start using it, Alex?
That would be episode three Across the Street.
#### ALEX
Although I couldn't tell you where in the episode it's mentioned in that
monologue.
#### JONNY
Oh, no, Graham has it. It's his, like, centrepiece. He's using it for coffee and stuff.
#### ALEX
But I can't remember at what point it's mentioned, is what I mean. Like, whether
it's like, just a buried reference.
#### JONNY
No, cos she, she's in the, she's in the flat, like, she's just kind of staring at the table
being like, 'Oooooh.'
#### ALEX
Yeah. It wasn't explicit reference. Yes. Yeah, you are correct. I'm glad you're here.
Otherwise, you know, I might actually be, uh, in trouble on this quiz. The
important thing is that right now, even though we're on the same team, none of us
is winning.
#### JONNY
Yeah, no, absolutely.
#### CHIOMA
Brilliant! The answer is Episode 3, Across the Street.
#### ALEX
Yes! I'm kind of getting genuinely competitive now and want to get a perfect score.
I want to be that person. And I don't think we can.
#### JONNY
Let's find out.
#### CHIOMA
Next question: Who leased an office at a 100 Pall Mall?
#### JONNY
100 Pall Mall? That's the underground Leitner library. So, it must be Leitner.
#### ALEX
Ah, no, no. Hang on. Hang on, hang on.
#### JONNY
Cos it's the Pall Mall club one.
#### ALEX
Yeah, no, no, I get that. I can't remember. Did they temporarily lease the place to
then break into stuff or... was it Leitner?
#### JONNY
No, no, cos they didn't break into stuff. They were doing repairs and stumbled into
it.
#### ALEX
Yes! No, you're right. It was repairs. It— so it was repairs. So—
#### JONNY
I'm not a hundred per cent sure, but there's no-one else I can think that it would
be, other than, Jurgen Leitner.
#### ALEX
No, you're right, because the repairs, they weren't leasing the place, they were
contracted.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
Okay, cool. Yeah, Leitner. Leitner's a good answer.
#### CHIOMA
It is, of course, Jurgen Leitner.
#### JONNY
I'll be honest, the entire premise of this episode is going to quite upset Mike. Cos I
told him that I'd looked over these questions to make sure they were accurate. And
I didn't.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS AND DESPAIRS]
#### ALEX
The second you're off the clock, Jonny, the, the absolute second you're off the
clock. God...
##### [JONNY CHUCKLES AND MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]
God... Okay.
#### JONNY
You should be happy because it means this episode can happen, otherwise...
#### ALEX
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
#### JONNY
—I couldn't legitimately do this quiz.
#### ALEX
Alright. Okay.
#### JONNY
I'm helping. In a very real way.
#### CHIOMA
What are the first words spoken in the show? Not counting trailers.
##### [ALEX MAKES A STRANGE SOUND]
#### JONNY
It will be 'Test, test. One, two, three.'?
#### ALEX
I don't know if it's 'one, two, three.' It's definitely 'Test, test.' I think it might be
'Test, test, one, two, one, two, test, test' or something.
#### JONNY
I feel like I remember saying a three.
#### ALEX
In which case then it will be something like, 'Test, test, one, two. One, two, three',
because at the time I would have found it hilarious that you said three.
#### JONNY
Let's just say, “Test, test.” Let's, let's go, you know...
#### ALEX
Fine.
#### JONNY
First words: “Test, test.”
#### ALEX
Go on. Let's go with “Test, test.”
#### CHIOMA
I'll give that to you, but the full answer is “Test, test, test, one, two, three, right?”
#### ALEX
Aw, come on, “Test, test—
#### JONNY
Okay, cool. So we— we're technically correct. We're technical correct.
#### ALEX
Yeah, we weren't given a number of words to get, so I think that wins.
#### JONNY
Yeah, no, absolutely.
#### ALEX
All audio should start with the words 'Test, test', and if it doesn't, you're doing it
wrong.
#### CHIOMA
Let's move on to Season 2, shall we. Nice and easy one to start with: Who gives the
first statement of Season 2?
##### [ALEX CHUCKLES DARKLY]
#### JONNY
I think that's, that's the Archivist, isn't it? Cos he goes in the— into the tunnels.
#### ALEX
Now hang on. Hang on. Hang on. So start of Season 2... We've done Jane
Prentiss.
#### JONNY
Tunnels are revealed.
#### ALEX
Is it not Martin talking about finding Gertrude's body?
#### JONNY
That's Episode 40. That's the last one of Season 1.
#### ALEX
Yes. Okay. I cheated the season break there. Okay.
#### JONNY
So there's 40, Human Remains, and then there's 41... Too Deep.
#### ALEX
Okay. Good catch. So in that case then, I feel like it isn't you.
#### JONNY
The Archivist goes into the tunnels and like, is givi— is saying like, 'Oh, went into
the tunnels and it was spooky.'
#### ALEX
I'll have to defer to the man himself. But I feel like I'm missing something there.
#### CHIOMA
Of course, it's our very own Jonathan Sims.
##### [ALEX IS FRUSTRATED]
#### JONNY
Yeah, we were setting up the whole conceit of Season 2. We, we were like, 'Oh, he
doesn't know what's going on. Is he's paranoid?'
#### CHIOMA
Daisy and John share a recurring nightmare. What familiar object does this
nightmare involve?
#### JONNY
Oh.
#### ALEX
I know that it is a plot point that Daisy realises that the dreams are weird because
of the T-shirt changing.
#### JONNY
Yeah.. But that's, that's Season 3.
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### JONNY
I don't think it's a T-shirt.
#### ALEX
No, it is, because she recognises his shirt is like, 'I'm with stupid' in the dream or
something.
#### JONNY
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. It is. It is the T-shirt in Season 3. But Season 2? Recurring
dream? I've completely blanked on this.
#### ALEX
We can work this out, logically. This is, this is Alex using pub quiz time.
#### JONNY
A knife!
#### ALEX
Now, now, hang on, hang on, hang on. Right.
#### JONNY
It's a knife!
#### ALEX
We know that you only get a shared dream with the Archivist after they've given a
statement, right?
#### JONNY
(Forlorn) A knife.
#### ALEX
So therefore, what was Daisy's first statement-esque thing?
#### JONNY
That would be Hard Shoulder. It was the one where she encountered Breekon and
Hope.
#### ALEX
So is it the coffin... that is the recurring dream, because of it being in the van and
so on?
#### JONNY
That would have been great foreshadowing, but I don't think we did that.
#### ALEX
I'm a bit stumped by that one. I think it could be coffin, or someone's been
wording their questions weird, and it's actually, like, the T-shirt or something.
#### JONNY
A knife
#### ALEX
But make your call Jonny. And if it's knife, I'm just going to go ahead and say—
#### JONNY
A knife.
#### ALEX
I'm going to say coffin. I'm going to say coffin.
#### CHIOMA
And Alex is correct! The answer is the Buried coffin.
#### ALEX
I'm winning! I'm winning!
#### JONNY
Alright. Okay.
#### ALEX
I'm better than Jonny at the thing that he primarily wrote. Mmmmmm.
#### CHIOMA
Next question. What building was previously located on the site of the Magnus
Institute?
#### ALEX
Oh! Millbank Prison.
#### JONNY
Also, I believe the Royal Chelsea Military Hospital.
#### ALEX
Yes. Above ground. And also it depends if they want to say the Panopticon.
#### JONNY
Millbank Prison was, like, the Panopticon, the two are kind of—
#### ALEX
I'm just trying to get at the wording, you see. Cos no-one checked these questions
beforehand, Jonny. You see? So, we've got to be really careful.
##### [JONNY GRUMBLES]
#### JONNY
Quiet, you.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
Uh, yeah.
#### ALEX
Millbank Prison slash the Panopticon... [LAUGHS]
#### JONNY
Slash the Royal Chelsea Military Hospital.
#### ALEX
...slash the Royal Chelsea military hospital.
#### CHIOMA
Fantastic. Straightforward one there, that's Milbank Prison.
#### ALEX
Yeah. Okay. That is the right answer. We're just hedging. We're hedging furiously
is what we're doing.
#### CHIOMA
In which episode does Melanie ask about the other Sasha?
#### JONNY
Oh, that's... So, Not!Sasha reveals itself in 79. So it would probably be 78, I want
to say.
#### ALEX
I can't believe I have to admit this. I'm going to have to just give up my lead and
pass this back to you on. I legitimately don't know.
#### JONNY
Is that The Kind Mother?
#### ALEX
I don't know.
#### JONNY
I'm going to say The Kind Mother.
#### ALEX
I have to confess, out of all the seasons, Season 2 is the one I've least had to
revisit.
#### JONNY
Also, like, this one specifically is really difficult because the statements were
recorded quite separate from the dialogue stuff. So matching the two up in my
head is tricky. I think it was The Kind Mother, I'm going to give that. Gonna roll
them dice.
#### CHIOMA
Good job there. It is of course, Episode 77, The Kind Mother.
(NOTE: There was a slight error on the answer sheet. The actual answer is
Episode 76, The Smell of Blood)
#### JONNY
#### YEAH!
#### ALEX
YES! Yes! Come on.
#### CHIOMA
Round three. First question, which key character dies at the end of Season 3?
#### JONNY
That would be, uh, Hope.
#### ALEX
Well, hang on? Hang on, hang on, hang on.
#### JONNY
Pretty sure Hope's the most important character that dies at the end of Season 3.
#### ALEX
In the Unknowing. Are you sure it's not Tim!? No, no, it won't be Tim. Cos he
didn't die.
#### JONNY
No, no. I mean, Tim does die, but like, that's, that's a pretty—
#### ALEX
Tim didn't die, I don't think.
#### JONNY
—Like, it's, it's not super important to the story, is the thing.
#### ALEX
No, you know what it'll be, it'll be Orsinov.
#### JONNY
Yeah, no, Orsinov is—
#### ALEX
It'll be Nikola Orsinov.
#### JONNY
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#### ALEX
There's no way it's Tim, cos who cares?
#### JONNY
Who remembers what Tim did?
#### ALEX
I don't even know his surname.
#### JONNY
Uh...
#### ALEX
I'm pretty sure it's, like, 'Meredith' or something.
##### [JONNY CRACKS UP]
#### JONNY
(Laughing) Sorry. 'Who died at the end of Season 3? Tim Meredith.'
##### [ALEX BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER]
We just had a huge— We've just got a huge backlog of his voice recordings and
they've been, like, just creating this whole artificial...
#### ALEX
I mean, ultimately, I feel like this question might be making light of all of the people
who were in that wax museum—
#### JONNY
Yeah!
#### ALEX
—who got turned, temporarily suspended, into wax. So in a lot of ways, the answer
is everyone. Everyone died, but definitely not Tim.
#### JONNY
Just to be clear, in terms of us getting points, I think we're saying Tim Stoker.
#### ALEX
I mean, points are more important than, you know, being liked. So yeah, let's go
with, let's go with Tim.
#### JONNY
Luckily we've managed to sacrifice both.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
#### CHIOMA
The answer is Tim Stoker.
#### ALEX
I do wonder what the body count in the Unknowing was? It was quite high...
#### JONNY
In my head, I would say like, a hundred and something, probably.
#### ALEX
Yeah, I was thinking in the hundreds.
#### CHIOMA
Let's move on. Who is The Big Bad of Season 3?
#### ALEX
I mean, if you look at how it's written, it's kind of Tim.
#### JONNY
Uh, that would be my good friend, Jessica Law, playing Nikola Orsinov, the evil
mannequin.
#### ALEX
Well, hang on, this is me overthinking.
#### JONNY
Oh, otherwise you could say The Stranger.
#### ALEX
This is the thing. Do we want to go higher level? I'd go with Orsinov, but I want it
on the record that, you know, that's a very broad question.
#### JONNY
Also, this is the season that Elias reveals himself.
#### ALEX
Exactly. So do we say Elias is the Big Bad? But I don't think Elias— Depends how
you define “Big Bad”. Elias is, sort of, 'the Bigger Bad', but I don't think he's 'the
Big Bad', he's 'a Big Bad'.
#### JONNY
I'd say the Big Bad is The Stranger via Nikola Orsinov.
#### ALEX
Seconded.
#### CHIOMA
Absolutely correct. The answer is The Stranger or Nikola Orsinov.
#### JONNY
Whoooo.
#### ALEX
I'm getting real worried. I think we're having an easy ride and then someone's
going to pose something really specific. And we're not even going to be able to
guess it.
#### CHIOMA
Next question: What was different about the intro music to Episode 119.
#### ALEX
Oh, yes!
#### JONNY
I don't know, Alex, help, I've never listened to an episode of this show.
##### [ALEX CHUCKLES]
#### ALEX
So Episode 119 was where I co-opted the intro music, so that instead of being
##### [REPLICATES SNIPPET OF MAG THEME] it was [REPLICATES AN
UPBEAT TRACK] cos it was the Unknowing music.
#### JONNY
Oh, clown music!
#### ALEX
Because the Unknowing started in the episode prior, so we wanted to set a real,
awful tone straight off the bat. And so, I think that it's playing the Unknowing
music, which is... my final answer. I think that's the answer.
#### JONNY
(Quickly) Yeah, it's my final answer as well. Our final answer.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
#### CHIOMA
Absolutely correct. It is the calliope music that was playing instead of the Magnus
theme.
#### JONNY
(Softly) Yeah.
#### ALEX
Yeah... the Calliope. Yeah, yeah. I did freeze for a moment there. I was a little bit
worried. I was like, 'Oh no, is it some really obscure, like, editing thing that I
forgot.
#### CHIOMA
Next question: During Season 3 of Magnus, Rusty Quill saw a wealth of new fan art
come through our postbox and on our socials. But there was one thing that was
sent to us more than anything else. What was it?
#### ALEX
In Season 3?
#### JONNY
I mean, I like— To be fair I, I had no visibility over the PO Box, so I'm going to
probably say teeth?
#### ALEX
Nah, it won't be teeth, it won't be teeth. We did get more biologically hazardous
waste than you might think. That had to be immediately destroyed. Please don't
send stuff like that. That's not cool. However, I don't think it'd be teeth.
So Season 3 wa— Oh no, it'd be Tim kayaking! Season 3? Fanart? It'd be Tim
kayaking. It's gotta be.
#### JONNY
Okay, I'll, I'll go with that.
#### ALEX
I've lost all confidence now. Okay. Give me a second to think. Cos the issue is I
haven't been administering the postbox either. Because the clowncore stuff for
Orsinov didn't actually come in, in Season 3. People started paying attention to
that in Season 4, there was a little bit of a delay.
So I think it's going to be, yeah, Tim kayaking. Do you concur Jonathan Sims?
#### JONNY
Yes, I concur Jonathan Sims.
##### [ALEX CHUCKLES]
Wait, no. I concur Alexander J Newall.
#### ALEX
Tim kayaking.
#### CHIOMA
Ooh, not so good. The answer's actually art based on the book, A Guest for Mr.
Spider.
##### [ALEX GROANS]
#### JONNY
Ohhhhhh, okay. Yeah. That makes sense.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah. Okay. That's annoying. I, I mean I'd— Ah, damn I really thought we
could get a perfect score on this one.
#### JONNY
It's alright.
#### ALEX
Wasn't teeth though. Thank god.
#### CHIOMA
Final question for Season 3: What was the name of the film produced in Episode
110, Creature Feature?
#### JONNY
I mean there were loads.
#### ALEX
But what were they filming in Creature Feature? They were filming...
#### JONNY
Ah, balls. I don't remember. Like, the thing is I made up so many film titles for
that. And I really— Like, some of them of, like, Agents of Orion and The Crawling
Ones, have stuck with me.
#### ALEX
But we had to workshop a bunch of them.
#### JONNY
Oh, it was— It's, it's 'spider' in a different language.
##### [ALEX MAKES AGONISED THINKING NOISES]
Like, it begins with a Z or something.
#### ALEX
Oh, no, we can get this on, we can get this one.
#### JONNY
I don't know if I can, I don't remember what—
#### ALEX
I'm, I'm confident we can get this one.
#### JONNY
It's like... Zemolotta?
#### ALEX
Zemilaya?
#### JONNY
Zemilaya?
#### ALEX
Ze— Hm... If it begins with a Z, that's what's coming to my mind. Oh, I feel like
we're homing in now.
#### JONNY
Yeah, I know, but I don't think I'm going to land on it.
I'm going to say Zemilaya, the Spider.
#### CHIOMA
Hmmm. Okay. Clearly we need to brush up on our Web knowledge. The answer is
Widow's Weave.
#### ALEX
Oh, was it?!
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### ALEX
Ahhh.
#### JONNY
Because the Z one is, like, the original, weird thing that, like, it's—
#### ALEX
That Lagorio saw, and then wanted to emulate in the— Ohhhh!
#### JONNY
Yeah, like, I'm thinking of, like, the faux kaiju thing.
#### ALEX
Yeah. Okay. No, I'm with you now. It was a remake of an obscure film that no-one
else ever actually thinks existed.
#### JONNY
Yeah. But that said, I did not remember the name Widow's Weave at all. That was
not even remotely in my head. So...
#### ALEX
No.
#### CHIOMA
Onto Season 4. In which island group did Salesa pick up the camera?
##### [ALEX GUFFAWS AND WINCES AUDIBLY]
#### JONNY
Oh no...
Oh no, you're asking me to remember some Google Maps search I did two years
ago.
#### ALEX
That's really tricky!
#### JONNY
I honestly don't know.
#### ALEX
Okay. If we just eliminate every island on the planet that it wasn't, we must end up
with the right answer. Probably wasn't the Galapagos. I don't think it was the
Seychelles.
#### JONNY
Don't think it was in the Hebrides.
#### ALEX
Probably not.
#### JONNY
Canaries?
#### ALEX
Isle of Man, right out.
#### JONNY
No, I'm pretty sure I sunk the Isle of Man.
##### [ALEX CHUCKLES]
#### ALEX
I got nothing.
#### JONNY
I'm going to say the Canaries. I don't believe it is, but I'm also drawing what's
known in the trade as 'an blank'.
#### CHIOMA
Oooh. The answer is actually the Maldives.
#### JONNY
Oh, the Maldives...
#### ALEX
(Mock angry) You sank the Maldives?! The Maldives are lovely!
#### JONNY
No, I sunk one of the Maldives. I sunk—
#### ALEX
I can't believe you sank the Maldives!
#### JONNY
I sunk a single Maldive.
#### ALEX
(Chuckling) You s— You sunk— Oh god, Jonny.
#### CHIOMA
In MAG147, Weaver, when Annabelle Cane runs away from home, what type of
shop does she hide out in?
#### JONNY
That would be an abandoned chip shop.
#### ALEX
She hides in a chip shop?
#### JONNY
Does she— No. It's based on a chip shop.
#### ALEX
Mmmm.
#### JONNY
The actual structure I'm thinking of is based on an actual brick chip shop I saw
years back.
#### ALEX
It's not the taxidermy office, is it?
#### JONNY
Oh no, no, no, no, no. This is the one near the beach. It's a square, brick building;
in the real world it was a chip shop. I cannot remember if I changed it and made it
some other bullshit.
#### ALEX
For some reason my memory is triggering on like a puppet... shop or something,
but that would be—
#### JONNY
No...
#### ALEX
—It wouldn't be that.
#### JONNY
It's not a puppet shop, it's too obvious.
#### ALEX
I wouldn't have allowed it to be that.
I don't think.
#### JONNY
Maybe— I probably did change it from a chip show. Cos that's too similar to—
#### ALEX
Sounds to me like what you should say is 'chip shop', right? And then say that the
quiz just doesn't understand the depths of your real world knowledge.
#### JONNY
A surf shop. I'm going to say a surf shop.
#### ALEX
No, there's no way it's a surf shop!
#### JONNY
No, I don't think it is a surf shop.
#### ALEX
You'd never have said a surf shop, never in a million years!
#### JONNY
But, like a gift shop? Like a tourist information shop, maybe?
#### ALEX
You might have to just go with 'chip shop' and just—
#### JONNY
Accept my luck. No, I'm going to say tourist information shop.
#### ALEX
I'll defer to you on this one. Cos I ain't got the right answer.
#### JONNY
I mean, I don't think I'm right, but...
#### ALEX
Well, don't say that as you lock the answer in. God...
#### CHIOMA
Perhaps you should trust your gut, Jonny. The correct answer was... chip shop.
#### ALEX
Waaaaaaaay! I told you, you'da got it with chip shop. Ha, Jonny mate, mate...
#### JONNY
It's fine. It's fine. Everyone can hear that I did know the answer, but what I lacked
was not knowledge, but self-confidence.
#### CHIOMA
Next question: After the founding of the Magnus Institute, how many years passed
before the ritual of The Watcher's Crown was completed?
#### JONNY
That would be 200 years, I believe.
#### ALEX
I think it's 200 on the nose, isn't it?
#### JONNY
Yeah. 1818 to 2018. I mean, technically, not actually.
#### ALEX
Wasn't it, like, a month or so off, or something?
#### JONNY
Well, uh, no, because the ritual that's conducted is not technically The Watcher's
Crown. The name 'The Watcher's Crown' is kind of a red herring.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah, yeah I guess
#### JONNY
So the question still works.
#### CHIOMA
Impressive. Yeah, 200 years -- 1818 'til 2018.
#### JONNY
I'll allow it.
#### ALEX
(Scoffs) You'll allow it?! [LAUGHS]
#### CHIOMA
How many times in Season 4 are John and Martin in the same scene together.
#### JONNY
Oh.
#### ALEX
Oh, okay. Okay. No, we can work this one out.
#### JONNY
It might just be the once. Like where— Well, okay, it depends on—
#### ALEX
It depends, do we count—
#### JONNY
Oh no, it's not, it's not just the once. There's a bunch of them, like—
#### ALEX
No, here's the thing, here's the thing, here's the thing, right?
Let's discount the trailer.
#### JONNY
Okay.
#### ALEX
Because that's not a scene, that's a trailer.
#### JONNY
There's 'You died!'
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
There's the final Lonely.
#### ALEX
You're doing this in a very awkward order for me. [CHUCKLES]
#### JONNY
Yeah. There's 'Let's gouge out our eyes and make out'. There's... two scenes in
160: 'Good cows' and 'Oh no!'
The question is how many scenes are there between that?
#### ALEX
Okay. Let's run through it in order. Let's run through it in order.
#### JONNY
I want to say seven.
#### ALEX
Okay. Cos the question was for the entirety of Season 4. So, going from the
beginning, right. 'You were dead' is definitely one.
#### JONNY
Yep.
#### ALEX
There's a meeting between John and Martin, where John's like 'Listen, I need to
warn you about Peter Lukas'. Is that the same one as the, You're— you were
dead'?
#### JONNY
(Whispers) I don't know.
I feel like there are either one, two or three meetings between 'You died' and 'Let's
gouge out our eyes'.
#### ALEX
So, I know what I'm like, structurally-speaking. I would expect me to have allowed
three scenes between the two of them, then end game.
#### JONNY
Then let's say... six or seven, pick your number.
#### ALEX
I am gonna say... six. Cos that way, if it's seven, we can say, 'Oh, they've counted
the trailer, so fnar fnar fnar'.
#### JONNY
(Whispers) I'm going to say seven.
#### ALEX
(Frustratedly) Oh Jonny, I hate you. It's going to be, like, 12 or something.
#### CHIOMA
Okay. I'll give that to you. It is five episodes. Episode 124, Left Hanging; Episode
129, Submerged; Episode 154, Bloody Mary; Episode 159, The Last; and Episode 160,
The Eye Opens.
#### ALEX
So five episodes, six scenes. So it's a moral victory for us, is what I'm hearing.
#### JONNY
Yeah. For us. Cos we both said six.
#### ALEX
Yeah, it's a, it's a moral victory, because we both definitely, definitely said six.
#### CHIOMA
Final question of Season 4. How many ribs does John possess at the end of Season
#### 4?
#### ALEX
Oh no, how many ribs does a human possess in general
#### JONNY
At the end of Season 4—
#### ALEX
Quiet Jonny! I'm counting my ribs. [CHUCKLES] Ow. Ow.
#### JONNY
Technically, at the end of Season 4, he's only missing one.
#### ALEX
But how many ribs do humans have?
#### JONNY
Ahhh...
#### ALEX
I don't know.
#### J
I don't know.
#### ALEX
I'm counting, but it just hurts.
#### JONNY
I'm going to say 21. Cos I think we normally have 22 ribs. He's lost one to Jared
Hopworth, and one is outside his body, but he still possesses it.
#### ALEX
Let's lock that in. It's the kind of thing Jonny'll know. And I'm, I'm hurting now
because I've been poked—
#### JONNY
I categorically do not know how many ribs a human has.
#### ALEX
I can't keep poking my torso. It's starting to hurt.
#### CHIOMA
Can't give that to you, I'm afraid. The answer is 23, however, one of these is in a
cupboard rather than his rib cage.
##### [ALEX GRIMACES]
#### JONNY
Ahhh, yeah. So, wh-what a human, normal human, has 24 ribs?
#### ALEX
Okay. There we go, there we go. We—
#### JONNY
Alex, you should have poked harder. I can't believe this.
#### ALEX
(Aggrieved) It hurts! I've legitimately bruised myself.
#### CHIOMA
Perhaps you should pay more attention to human anatomy. Oh well, onto Season
5. Gertrude inherited Fiona Law as an assistant when she became Archivist. What
is it that saved Fiona from being a victim of most, but not all, Powers?
#### JONNY
##### [MAKES CREAKING SOUND EFFECT]... thump.
That's the sound of somebody fainting.
#### ALEX
Yeah, she just passed out all the time, didn't she?
#### JONNY
See, there was Emma, Fiona, Michael, and I want to say Sarah, and one of them
survived lots by fainting. And I— And if Fiona Law was the long-lived one, then
that will be it.
#### ALEX
Because that's the thing is, the one that I'm confused on here, cos I'm not a
hundred percent is, there was one of them who kept passing out, and then there
was the other one who survived quite long by making everyone else go first and
was in fact tormenting.
#### JONNY
I think that was Emma.
#### ALEX
But who's the question referring to then?
#### JONNY
Fiona. Uh, like the, like the question I believe is— yeah.
#### ALEX
Alright, I'll give you that one. Fiona, fainting. Fainting, yeah.
#### CHIOMA
Terrific! The answer is fainting.
##### [NOISES OF SUCCESS]
#### ALEX
Yeah, there you go. Good job. Good job. I liked that as a story point as well. That
was a nice little, like— I really liked that. It just resonated.
#### CHIOMA
Let's move on. How many characters does John successfully smite in Season 5?
Name them.
#### JONNY
Oh, god.
Right. So... first one is Jude Perry. Uh, no! First one is the Not!Sasha.
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### JONNY
Then there's Jude Perry.
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### JONNY
Jared.
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### JONNY
Doesn't take out Oliver.
#### ALEX
No.
#### JONNY
Doesn't take out Simon.
#### ALEX
No. Are we then onto Helen?
#### JONNY
No, there's definitely someone before Helen. The whole Basira / Daisy thing is,
like, between them. He doesn't do any smiting there.
#### ALEX
That, that's moot. He doesn't do anything with Salesa, obviously.
#### JONNY
He isn't the one that kills Trevor.
#### ALEX
Nope.
#### JONNY
No-one gets smote in Salesa's... I feel like there's one I'm missing.
#### ALEX
I think it might go straight to Helen.
#### JONNY
(Softly) Really? I feel like there's another. (Croaky) There is... another...
##### [CHUCKLES]
#### ALEX
The reason I don't think there is, is because, again, this is me revealing all my story
structures. You get three beats and then you get your big bash.
#### JONNY
(Pondering) Yeah.
#### ALEX
So you've got three beats there, and then you've got Helen. I don't think there is
another one because we'd be hitting it too hard.
#### JONNY
And he kills Elias, but he doesn't smite Elias.
#### ALEX
If they count Elias, then fair enough. But I don't think there's anyone pre-Helen.
I might say four brackets five, if you count Elias.
#### ALEX
Last chance, if you think there's anything before Helen, but I don't... think...
there is.
#### JONNY
Yeah. I-I can't lay my finger on it.
#### ALEX
I think it's the three we discussed, then I think it's Helen for a fourth.
#### JONNY
Oh! Breekon!
#### ALEX
Oh! Does—
#### JONNY
Yeah. Breekon asks to be got.
#### ALEX
Yeah, there is a mercy smite. You're right. I can't remember. We do grant Breekon
that, don't we?
#### JONNY
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#### ALEX
Yeah. So it's four, then it's five with Helen. So then you're into five brackets six.
#### JONNY
No, I think it's six brackets, because it's Not!Sasha...
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
Jude...
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
Jared...
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
Breekon...
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
Helen.
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### JONNY
Oh, yeah, okay. So yeah, five brackets six. If we count Jonah.
#### ALEX
Five brackets six, then. Good catch on the, uh, Breekon one.
And I'd have missed that.
#### JONNY
I almost did.
#### ALEX
Lock it in, then, five brackets six.
#### JONNY
Yeah, yeah, yeah, five brackets six.
#### CHIOMA
The answer is five -- the Not!Them / Not!Sasha, Jude Perry, Jared Hopworth,
Breekon, and Helen.
##### [ALEX GIVES A SIGH OF RELIEF]
#### ALEX
Yeah, getting answers wrong on Season 5 is a particularly egregious error.
##### [LAUGHS] We kinda got to bat for a thousand right now
#### CHIOMA
Which tea type does Martin hate?
#### JONNY
I want to say oolong.
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### JONNY
Or lapsang souchong.
#### ALEX
Oh, ha, ooh. I think it'd be oolong.
#### JONNY
I'm going to say oolong. It's one of those details that, like, I threw in. It's
important, I think, that as a character point, Martin dislikes a particular type of tea.
#### CHIOMA
Absolutely correct. The answer is oolong.
Next question: The statement of Episode 189, Peers, includes the sound of three
men in fine suits laughing. Which Rusty Quill member is the uncredited performer
of said guffaws?
#### JONNY
(Cheerily) Oh, I think I know this one! I think it's Tim Meredith. This actually
makes a lot of sense now because someone mentioned Tim Meredith getting an
uncredited performance in Season 5.
And I was like, 'What?! He did what?!'
#### ALEX
If it is, A, I did not allow it.
##### [JONNY LAUGHS]
And B, I know that Elizabeth would have put a request out, knowing that I
forbade it anyway. So I think it might be... Tim Meredith, I think you're right.
(Chuckling) And I think Elizabeth has some explaining to do.
#### JONNY
Let's find out.
#### CHIOMA
Great guess! The answer is Tim Meredith.
##### [JONNY SOFTLY CHUCKLES AS ALEX ROARS]
#### ALEX
Ohhhh, someone's in trouble now! This was meant to be a Tim-free zone. I can't
believe someone's sneaked Tim into our glorious creation. It's soured for me now.
It's like putting a bit of lime juice in milk -- the whole lot's going to slowly ruin.
##### [JONNY CONTINUES LAUGHING]
Blergh.
#### JONNY
You have given him a whole show.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
#### ALEX
I'm going to keep paying him to make stuff. But that's not the point!
#### CHIOMA
The final question of Season 5: Who in a statement is described as “insecure,
aggressive, and desperate to be taken seriously”?
#### JONNY
Oh.
#### ALEX
Ooh, I quite like that question. “Insecure, aggressive and desperate to be taken
seriously”...
#### JONNY
It's going to be the Archivist, isn't it?
#### ALEX
I think it is, yeah.
#### JONNY
Yeah. I forget who was giving a statement about—
#### ALEX
Rosie?
#### JONNY
Yes! I think it is.
#### ALEX
I think it's Rosie's Panopticon statement.
#### JONNY
I think it's Rosie's perception of the Archivist. Yeah, I think that's it. Good work.
#### ALEX
Final answer.
#### CHIOMA
Terrific! The answer is, of course, the Archivist.
#### ALEX
Yeah! Good job! Good job! We're doing respectably now.
#### JONNY
Alright, I was a bit worried.
#### CHIOMA
Just as an extra little treat, we've got a bonus round for you here.
#### ALEX
Okay.
#### JONNY
Bonus round!
#### ALEX
Okay, these are going to be tricky.
#### CHIOMA
What was the last in-studio recording date for Season 5? So, you know, cast your
mind back to pre-COVID times.
#### JONNY
Urgh...
#### ALEX
Dates?!
#### JONNY
Yikes.
#### ALEX
I think it was you, Jonny.
#### JONNY
Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on. It was the Saturday before— Sasha's birthday
party was on the fourth; it was the Saturday before that.
So what was the Saturday before the 4th of March?
#### ALEX
I don't know. I don't know. February sometimes has different numbers of days, I
know that.
#### JONNY
I don't think it was a leap year. I'm going to roll the dice. That birthday party was
on a Saturday, which we would have made Saturday the 4th of March, which
means rolling that back... I'm going to say February the 25th.
To be fair, this question is just two old men being, like, 'Now, so I think it was—'
#### ALEX
'It was a Tuesday!'
#### JONNY
'I think it was 1963.'
#### ALEX
'It was a Tuesday, because I always eat soup on a Tuesday. It could have been a
stew, but if it was a stew, it might've been a Wednesday.'
#### JONNY
'I hadn't gotten the Citroën—
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
—but I was still working. I was still working at Broad Street, so—
#### ALEX
(Laughing) I just had a vision of us on a porch as irritating old men who refuse to
listen to each other or anyone else. And won't stop talking.
#### JONNY
I mean, that's just us now.
#### ALEX
Yeah. But there'll be a porch! That's the dream.
#### CHIOMA
The answer is the 14th of March 2020.
#### JONNY
Really? There was one after the— I thought that the— No, fair enough.
#### ALEX
You're talking to someone who deleted the entirety of production from my brain.
#### JONNY
Yeah.
#### CHIOMA
Which Magnus Archives cast or crew member struggles to listen to the show because
it is too scary.
#### JONNY
I mean a bunch of them, I think.
#### ALEX
Here's the thing. I know it's a bit of a thing with the fans that Bryn doesn't listen.
#### JONNY
Oh, is it Alex?
#### ALEX
No, it's not, cos I don't get scared by horror. It will be Bryn, because Bryn makes a
point of saying specifically he doesn't listen because it's too scary, as opposed to
everyone else who says they don't listen to it because we're talentless hacks who are
getting in the way of the real creatives. So I think it will be Bryn.
#### JONNY
That's reasonable, uh, yeah.
#### CHIOMA
The correct answer is, and I cannot believe you forgot your producer, Lowri.
#### ALEX
Oh that is a foolish question!
#### JONNY
Ohhhhh, that'll be it. Sorry Lowri.
#### ALEX
Well, I maintain that Bryn also says it's too scary! I query the question!
#### JONNY
Sorry Lowir.
#### CHIOMA
Let's move on, shall we? In Season 5, approximately how many individual SFX
samples did Elizabeth use at least once?
#### ALEX
Oh-hoh-hoh-hoh...
#### JONNY
How many sound effect samples?
#### ALEX
This is going to be a very distressingly high figure.
#### JONNY
I am going to say 5,000.
#### ALEX
I'm having to think about order of magnitude, never mind how many.
So samples that she used at least once. We did reuse some assets. So that's one of
the tricks with audio drama is you can use a storm from a different one as a new
storm in a different one if you add an extra element, but even then...
#### JONNY
I am going to say 5,000.
#### ALEX
I am going to say 3,851.
#### CHIOMA
Ooh! Wrong! The answer is roughly 1,355.
#### JONNY
Is that all?
#### ALEX
I am better!
#### JONNY
Thant's amateur hour!
#### ALEX
Also. I feel like that might be conservative, but it might be that she's talking only
about new stuff that was introduced in Season 5. Maybe it's because we reused
more than, than previous.
#### JONNY
I mean, it's a good start, Elizabeth. Call me when you've hit 5,000.
#### ALEX
You shut your mouth, Jonny! You have no idea!
#### JONNY
I know, I know, I know.
#### ALEX
Half the time she's been running around with her recorder, trying to find sounds in
a pandemic, just being like, 'I can make this work! I can make this work!' Poor
woman.
#### CHIOMA
Next question: Outside of Alex, which editor worked on the most episodes across
all seasons.
#### JONNY
Which editor is inside of Alex?
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
#### ALEX
This is actually surprisingly tricky question.
#### JONNY
I feel like I want to say Elizabeth.
#### ALEX
It could be Brock. Brock is the music editor who rarely gets paid attention, but the
difference is, he's done a lot, like a lot of edits. In terms of hours, it'll be Elizabeth,
but in terms of actual number of completed edits...
#### JONNY
I'm going to defer to you on this one, because obviously you understand all the
production staff kind of blend together to me, you know...
#### ALEX
Urgh, Jonny!
#### JONNY
They're just one amorphous blob that I, I gift my genius to. And they, uh, they've
turned it into something acceptable, you know.
#### ALEX
It's definitely between Elizabeth or Brock. I am going to say something
controversial, and guess Brock by, like, one episode or something,. But over the
years, it's very difficult to pin. I think it's actually going to be Brock, but not by
much.
#### JONNY
What's Brock's surname? You've just said Brock a lot.
#### ALEX
Oh, sorry. Brock Winstead.
#### JONNY
I'm going to say Elizabeth, because I trust in Elizabeth.
#### ALEX
Oh, now I'm the villain! Argh.
#### JONNY
Cos we're, we're besties.
#### ALEX
No, Brock. I'm going to say Brock. I'm gonna say Brock Winstead. I'm going to
say Brock, but not by much.
#### CHIOMA
Point to you, Alex, the answer is Brock Winstead.
##### [ALEX IS OVERJOYED]
#### ALEX
Yes!
#### JONNY
Elizabeth, you let me down. I believed in you.
#### ALEX
Elizabeth has definitely spent the most amount of time working on the show, like
categorically, but not raw numbers of credits.
#### JONNY
But not in such a way that earns me a point.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
#### CHIOMA
And the final question of this quiz: Who is the last character to drop the F-bomb
on this show?
#### ALEX
Oh no, that's surprisingly tricky.
#### JONNY
Hmmm.
#### ALEX
I think it's Melanie where it's like, 'You just want to stab Elias.' She's like, 'If you
think that, you can f*** off out my tunnels on your high horse.' I think that might
be the final F-bomb.
#### JONNY
Yeah, I think that's it. It's definitely in 199, because 200, a swear would have
lessened the impact.
#### ALEX
We said “bastard”.
#### JONNY
Well, no, but that's deliberate that it wasn't anything worse, because it's a weirdly
fine line to walk with swearing.
#### ALEX
I don't believe there was any expletives throughout 200—
#### JONNY
No.
#### ALEX
—even if it was like, 'Oh no!' as in, like, 'Oh s***!' or whatever.
I don't think there was anything like that.
#### JONNY
I think it was Melanie, said f*** off out her tunnels.
#### ALEX
'F*** off out my tunnels on your high horse.' Yeah, I think that's it.
#### CHIOMA
That's right! It's Melanie in Episode 199. Brilliant!
#### ALEX
(Triumphant) Aw yes!
#### JONNY
I mean, that would it be embarrassing if we hadn't? Cos it wasn't that long ago we
wrote and recorded it.
#### ALEX
Okay. So I realise that we were on the same team, but at the same time, I kind of
want to know who won within our team. So...
#### JONNY
I want to know how much I beat you by.
#### ALEX
Ah, yeah, sure. Sure, sure.
#### JONNY
It's important for the records.
#### ALEX
Who's the MVP of this quote 'team'.
#### CHIOMA
Out of a possible 29 points. That's 20 for Jonny and 22 for Alex. Not that it's a
competition at all [CHUCKLES]
#### ALEX
#### YES!
#### JONNY
I don't think that's...
#### ALEX
Yes! I think, I think that is accurate
#### JONNY
Think what you've got to remember, though, Alex is a dirty cheat.
#### ALEX
Jonny, it's fine. I'm fine with us being credited as a team. When I privately know
there's an extra couple of points kicking around there and that's okay. That's okay.
Jonny.
#### JONNY
You have to remember is that they've edited out all the additions— There were
like ten more questions that I nailed—
#### ALEX
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
#### JONNY
They've edited it out because Alex threw a strop and they've gotta make him look
good.
##### [ALEX LAUGHS]
That's what happened.
#### ALEX
Control history. That's, that's the trick there, yeah.
No, I'd like to give a special thanks to, uh, Brock for being the secret sauce behind
this, uh, not a win necessarily, that's a strong word, but this triumph, this
monumental achievement, I don't know.
#### JONNY
I would say embarrassment for you. That you're putting such store by a quiz that
doesn't even matter.
##### [ALEX CONTINUES TO LAUGH THROUGH JONNY'S RAMBLING]
Like it's not— It's fine. You know, this was just for fun, it was just a little bit, a
little bit of post-season content that doesn't, doesn't matter.
#### ALEX
(Struggling through laughter) And on that I think we should say bye.
Bye everyone!
#### JONNY
Anyway, I've got to go and do something else. Something that is important, and
not just a waste of my time. So, you know, bye Alex.
#### CHIOMA
So, that's it from me, I hope you've enjoyed this episode. Stay tuned as we have
even more bonus episodes coming your way over the next few weeks.
Goodbye! And thanks for listening.
