#### 1. INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE -- NIGHT, THUNDERSTORM (SAM'S
PHONE)
SAM and CELIA sit in the quiet train as it rumbles through the
night. Sam's phone buzzes. He checks it, sighs, and rejects the
call, leaving it on the table. He sounds ill.
#### CELIA
You can't ignore her forever.
#### SAM
I just don't know what to say to her. I
was kind of hoping she wouldn't
check her voicemail for another few
hours.
#### CELIA
You really think she's that upset?
#### SAM
Five calls in seven minutes, and a
bunch of messages.
#### CELIA
What does she say?
#### SAM
Dunno. Can't quite bring myself to
check just yet.
#### CELIA
Alice means well, but she doesn't
really understand.
#### SAM
I don't know. Maybe she's right.
#### CELIA
What?
#### SAM
When I started at the O.I.A.R. she
told me not to let it get to me. Now
look at me.
#### CELIA
You were attacked.
#### SAM
Yeah by something I released.
Because I let stuff get to me.
Because I got curious.
Beat. Sam grunts and rubs his face.
SAM(CONT'D)
My head is killing me.
#### CELIA
I'm not surprised. When I saw you
lying out there, I thought... Well
Yeah. Headache makes sense.
She gets some painkillers from her bag and hands them to him.
#### CELIA
Here. You need water?
#### SAM
Nah.
He dry-swallows them.
#### CELIA
(smiling)
Ooh, tough guy.
Sam gives a weak laugh that turns into a coughing fit.
#### CELIA
You're lucky we didn't need to run to
catch the last Oxford train.
#### SAM
Or unlucky.
#### CELIA
Second thoughts?
#### SAM
I don't know. It's just starting to feel
kind of faraway now. I was so certain
we had to get to the Hilltop Centre
a.s.a.p but now...
He makes a non-committal noise.
#### CELIA
Well, I don't think there's another
train back till tomorrow morning so
we may as well do a bit of snooping.
#### SAM
I know. Just wish I could focus
properly.
They sit in silence for a bit. The storm is quietening.
#### CELIA
Rains easing off at least.
#### SAM
That's good.
Beat.
SAM (CONT'D)
Thanks Celia.
#### CELIA
For what?
#### SAM
For coming with me. You didn't have
to.
#### CELIA
It sounded like you'd have gone
anyway. At least this way I can make
sure it all goes to plan.
#### SAM
(small laugh)
There's a plan?
#### CELIA
Besides, you're not the only one
who's curious.
Beat.
#### SAM
Well, I still appreciate it.
#### CELIA
Anyway, what if you were right?
When you said we had to go now or
something terrible would happen?
You'd just had a weird monster in
your brain, maybe it was the truth.
#### SAM
Christ, I hope not. I do not feel up to
an apocalyptic conflict right now.
#### CELIA
Hopefully the painkillers should be
kicking in soon. Rest up. We're safe
here.
#### 2. INT. PADDINGTON STATION -- NIGHT, THUNDERSTORM
(ALICE'S PHONE)
ALICE is frantically listening to her phone ring out.
#### ALICE
(to self)
Come on Sam, you goddamned- Pick
up pick up pick up.
There's a beep as the call is rejected.
#### ALICE
(shouting at phone)
It's following you, you stupid-!
The TICKET OFFICER comes over, clearly irritated by her
outburst.
#### TICKET OFFICER
Excuse me miss, I'm going to have
to ask you to reign it in.
#### ALICE
(not sorry)
Sorry.
#### TICKET OFFICER
I don't want to have to ask you to
leave.
#### ALICE
Ok, alright, I get it.
She takes a moment to compose herself.
The ticket officer seems satisfied, for now. They start moving
off.
ALICE (CONT'D)
(suddenly)
Wait, where's the ticket office?
#### TICKET OFFICER
Closed for the night. Machine's over
there.
#### ALICE
Are there any more trains going to
Oxford tonight?
#### TICKET OFFICERS
Check the board.
#### ALICE
(vicious)
I know I can check the bloody board I
just thought you might be, I don't
know, useful?
Beat.
#### TICKET OFFICER
(not paid enough for this)
You have a good night, miss.
Alice hurries over to a ticket machine and starts using it in a
rush.
ALICE (CONT'D)
(to self)
Right. O... X... Oxford, One. Adult.
No railcard. God, I don't know,
“Anytime day return?”
Beat.
ALICE (CONT'D)
How much?
Alice's phone starts to ring. She looks and sees COLIN is
calling.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Christ, now? Seriously?
She answers. Colin sounds scared.
#### COLIN
(phone)
A-Alice?
#### ALICE
(irritated)
Yeah, Colin, I'm here.
Alice continues pressing the touchscreen, confirming the
tickets.
#### COLIN
(phone)
Are you in the office at the moment?
#### ALICE
Uh, no. Why?
The machine gives a disapproving beep.
#### ALICE
(muttering)
For god's sake...
She puts her card into the machine and starts to enter her PIN.
#### COLIN
(phone)
I-I need your help.
I'm, uh, I'm in trouble.
#### ALICE
Like, right now? I'm not really- I'm
kind of in the middle of something...
#### COLIN
(phone)
I messed up, Alice. Freddy's... I
messed up.
Alice takes her card out and the machine prints her tickets.
#### ALICE
(harassed)
Okay, I'll come round first thing
tomorrow okay, and then we canyou can tell me what you think is
going on with Freddy then, yeah?
Beat.
ALICE (CONT.)
Colin?
#### COLIN
(phone, resigned)
Yeah, sure. Sorry to bother you.
Goodbye, Alice.
#### ALICE
Colin? Listen, I'll be there as soon
asColin hangs up. Alice stands torn between the last train and
Colin.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Ah crap...
3. INT. OIAR OFFICES -- NIGHT, THUNDERSTORM (COMPUTER)
GWEN sits alone in the office typing. She takes a moment and
sighs. LENA returns to the office and approaches.
#### GWEN
(wary)
Lena...?
#### LENA
I've just had a call from Trevor
Herbert MP.
#### GWEN
(coiled)
Oh. Did he... enjoy his visit?
#### LENA
He certainly found it illuminating.
#### GWEN
I'm glad.
Icy Pause.
#### LENA
If my job was all that was at stake
here, I'd probably praise your
initiative. I have no idea where
you've been digging these files up
from, but you've certainly used them
effectively, and bluntly...
#### GWEN
I have no ideaLENA
(continuing regardless)
But there is much more at play here
than you know and you are not
prepared for the scale of
responsibility about to crash down
on your shoulders.
#### GWEN
I'm sorry?
#### LENA
No you aren't. But I think you will be.
#### GWEN
(squaring for a fight)
Is that a threat?
#### LENA
Goodbye, Gwen.
Lena moves to leave.
#### GWEN
(thrown, almost
disappointed)
What? That's it?
#### LENA
That's it. Give the others my regards
and best of luck. You're all going to
need it.
LENA exits. GWEN sits in stunned silence for a moment. Then
she starts to laugh in disbelief.
4. THE HILLTOP CENTRE EXT. -- NIGHT, CLEAR (SAM'S PHONE)
SAM and CELIA have just emerged from a taxi. Sam closes the
car door behind them.
#### TAXI DRIVER
You're sure? There's not much
round here...
#### SAM
We're fine, really.
#### TAXI DRIVER
Fair enough
#### CELIA
Cheers.
The taxi drives off, leaving them alone in the empty urban night.
#### CELIA
So I'm guessing that's it then.
Beat.
CELIA (CONT'D)
You alright?
#### SAM
Just checking for tape recorders.
#### CELIA
Look, even if it was on the train,
which we can't be sure of, there's no
way it could have beaten us here. I
mean, how many eyes did you say it
had?
#### SAM
Plenty.
#### CELIA
Then yeah, I doubt it's getting a lift.
So we're okay for now at least. Come
on.
They start walking.
#### SAM
What unit did you say it was?
#### CELIA
Seventeen, according to Helen's
records, but it doesn't say if there
was a shop there or anything.
#### SAM
So how do we know which unit is
which? Most don't even have signs
left...
Celia takes a moment, breathes in and centers herself.
#### CELIA
This way.
#### SAM
You're sure?
#### CELIA
Call it a hunch.
Sam is unconvinced but follows her anyway. The center is
mostly derelict and utterly abandoned at this time at night.
Sam begins to hum nervously to himself.
Pause.
#### CELIA
Sam?
#### SAM
Hm? Oh, sorry. This place is just
making me a bit nervous you know?
#### CELIA
(distracted)
Mhmm.
#### SAM
I don't think it's actually, like,
properly abandoned. Some of the
shops look in decent nick...
#### CELIA
Maps does still list a bunch of
businesses here, but no websites or
opening times or anything.
They walk on.
#### SAM
I can see why... Like, that can't be a
real dentist right?
#### CELIA
“We want your teeth!”
#### SAM
Yeah. That's not normal.
#### CELIA
I think it's normal for here.
Beat.
#### SAM
Maybe we should come back in the
daytime...
#### CELIA
What happened to stopping that
“Archivist”?
#### SAM
Yeah wellThere is a gentle knocking from inside a nearby shop.
#### SAM CONT.
(nervous)
Uuuhhhh...
#### CELIA
(ready)
Shhhh.
Beat. The knocking repeats.
#### SAM
(hushed)
I think it's coming from that old
appliance store...
#### CELIA
Then it's not unit seventeen.
(moving on)
Ignore it.
#### SAM
But it looks like it's open...
#### CELIA
Yes it is, and it's probably coming
from inside a washing machine, or a
fridge, or something else with a
suspicious door and we both know
what happens if we open it.
#### SAM
(Following)
Yeah... I really wish my job wasn't to
just learn about all the horrible
things that can happen to you in a
place like this.
#### CELIA
Try to think of it as preparation. Now,
I'm guessing that it's just around
thisThey turn a corner and walk straight into the CUSTODIAN.
#### CUSTODIAN
Hey!
#### SAM
Argh!
CELIA shoves him back on instinct.
#### CUSTODIAN
(tumbling backwards)
Argh!
The mutual shock fades as they realise the CUSTODIAN seems
normal enough.
#### CUSTODIAN
Christ, what was that for?
#### CELIA
Sorry, it was a reflex.
#### CUSTODIAN
That's one hell of a reflex.
#### SAM
Here let me help.
#### CUSTODIAN
(standing with Sam's help)
What the hell are you two doing
sneaking around here at this time of
night?
#### CELIA
We could ask you the same
question.
#### CUSTODIAN
I work here.
#### SAM
Sorry, you work here?
#### CUSTODIAN
Yeah. I clean up, make sure
everything stays locked up.
#### SAM
Like the one with all the banging?
#### CUSTODIAN
Ah, crap. Which one was it?
#### SAM
Uh... Gray's Appliances?
#### CUSTODIAN
Right, I'd better go lock it back up
before... well... Look, you two need
to leave. It's not safe here, the lights
have mostly gone and the uh... the
structure is weak soCELIA
It's alright, you can just say it's
haunted.
Beat. The CUSTODIAN sizes them up.
#### CUSTODIAN
(relieved)
Ok, yeah. This place is haunted, like
ridiculously haunted and dangerous
with it. I dunno if you're wannabe
ghost-hunters or something... but
trust me, this place isn't for you
There is a slight gust of wind and a suspiciously timed scrape of
rusted metal.
Beat.
#### CUSTODIAN
You should go.
#### SAM
Celia...
#### CELIA
We have business in one of the
units.
The custodian lets out a long sigh.
#### CUSTODIAN
Fine, just leave me out of it.
#### CELIA
If you like.
#### CUSTODIAN
I do. Which unit?
#### CELIA
Seventeen.
#### CUSTODIAN
The old “Outreach Centre”?
#### SAM
Yeah, I think so? For the Magnus
Institute?
#### CUSTODIAN
If you say so. No-one's been there in
decades... Come on, I keep the front
locked tight, but I can let you in the
service entrance.
#### CELIA
(suspicious)
Just like that?
#### CUSTODIAN
You learn to go with the flow here,
and stay out of the way of whatever
goes on. I just keep it clean and lock
up when I can. If you're stupid
enough to go poking around... that's
on you. I've said my piece.
#### SAM
Well that's not exactly reassuring...
#### CUSTODIAN
No, I don't imagine it is.
5. EXT. OXFORD STATION -- NIGHT, CLEAR (ALICE'S PHONE)
ALICE steps onto the pavement, getting her bearings. She spots
a taxi and heads over. The TAXI DRIVER lowers his window.
#### TAXI DRIVER
Where to?
#### ALICE
Hey, are there any other taxis
working tonight?
#### TAXI DRIVER
(offended)
Probably, but I'm the only one here
so you take it or leave itALICE
Sorry, no, yeah. It's just- I'm looking
for someone.
#### TAXI DRIVER
(skeptical)
Right.
Alice flicks through her phone to a picture of SAM.
#### ALICE
Uhh... This guy, Sam, have you seen
him tonight?
#### TAXI DRIVER
I can't tell you that. Client
confidentiality, you know how it is?
#### ALICE
Fifty quid.
#### TAXI DRIVER
Yeah, I took him and a lady friend
over to that creepy old shopping
center up Cowley way. Weird, but I
don't judge.
#### ALICE
How fast can you get me there?
#### TAXI DRIVER
This time of night? Ten minutes,
easy.
#### ALICE
Wicked, you're on.
#### TAXI DRIVER
Look, it's none of my business but
I'm not getting involved in any, like,
crime of passion stuff alright? I don't
want to be a witness to anything.
#### ALICE
No, no it's nothing like that, promise.
Now can we go?
#### TAXI DRIVER
Sure, after I get the fifty.
Beat.
#### ALICE
Fair.
#### 6. EXT. THE HILLTOP CENTRE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (TAPE
RECORDER)
The Custodian approaches the electronics store where the
knocking can still be heard. He sighs, irritated, sorting through a
huge ring of keys.
#### CUSTODIAN
Shut up!
The knocking stops.
CUSTODIAN (CONT'D)
(muttering)
Just one boring night. Is that so
much to ask?
He finds the key he was looking for and pulls down the shutter
to the electronics store. He gives it a rattle to confirm it's locked
before grunting in satisfaction.
CUSTODIAN (CONT'D)
Can't believe I'm still here after all
these years. Looking after this place
is as much about what you don't see
as what you do. The first time I came
hereHe coughs, confused by the outburst then the words once start
spilling out once again.
CUSTODIAN (CONT'D)
The first time I came here I knew
something wasn't right. I used to
clean hospitals, and I know what
dried blood looks likeThe Custodian places his hand over his mouth to stop himself
from speaking. The ARCHIVIST emerges from the shadows.
#### ARCHIVIST
#### SPEAK.
The Custodian struggles against the compulsion.
#### CUSTODIAN
-and here it- it was everywhere...
...everywhere...
#### ARCHIVIST
#### SPEAK.
The dam breaks and the words gush from the CUSTODIAN's
mouth.
7. EXT. THE HILL TOP CENTRE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (CASE)
#### CUSTODIAN
I didn't believe it, of course. Didn't let
myself recognise it but I still saw it,
right from the start. In the corners, in
the cracks. Was it from the victims of
awful place? Was it mixed into the
concrete when it was first raised? Or
do the buildings just bleed? Is this
place a wound that never fully heals?
I don't know, but on hot summer
nights I can smell it.
So why take the job? You wouldn't
ask me if you could see my payslips
for these last thirty years.
Life was bad when I met the owner.
He smiled so wide, like he was so
unbelievably pleased to offering me
such an opportunity.
I asked about the blood, I couldn't
help myself. He just smiled and
added another ten grand to the
salary. I didn't ask any other
questions. I never even learned his
name.
From that moment on it was just the
three of us: me, the bloodstained
silent concrete of the Hilltop Centre,
and the dark.
In all my time, I have never come
during the day. It would break some
strange unspoken rule. I don't know
if anyone has ever come here
shopping, I don't know what shops
are still open. I don't know if it
closed down years ago and I'm a just
another ghost loitering amongst the
great grey corpse.
I know that it gets other visitors,
though. I know because I clean up
bits of them sometimes. A patch of
torn-out hair, a half-melted tooth, a
rotted fingernail torn from the root.
Never enough to matter to anyone
else. I try not to see these days.
I ward people away at night, warn
them that they shouldn't be here.
Usually they listen, but not always. I
remember the first time someone
wouldn't turn away. It was the winter
of ninety-seven. A man staggered up
to me, stinking of cheap booze and
piss. He wanted to buy a lighter. I
told him to leave, I told him that all
the shops here were shut. He called
me a liar.
Then I noticed the light illuminating
me from behind. One of the
shopfronts, a newsagent I'd never
paid much attention to, was open
and apparently always had been.
What's more, there was a haggard
yet eager old woman I had never
seen before stood behind the
counter. I tried to warn the man but
he just shoved me out of the way
and walked inside. I went to clean
the far side of the Centre and
ignored the smell of burnt hair and
charred meat.
It wasn't all death though.
Sometimes people... arrived. Not
often, but every now and then you'd
find some thin, emaciated soul
wandering around, lost and
confused. Ambulance would come
and take them away. Maybe they're
fine, but I doubt it.
I only called the police once. Only
once. It was the whimpering. There's
always noises when you're cleaning,
but you lock them up or curse them
out and they shut up. But this time it
didn't. It just kept on going, and
going, from one of the clothing
stores near the east exit. Patience, I
think it was called.
And this time, I broke the one of the
unspoken rules, I had a look.
At first there was nothing, just
darkness and clothing and
motionless mannequins. But the
whimpering still filled the shop. I
checked the mannequins and it was
on the third one that I realized what
was happening: why the outfit was
so mismatched, why the clothes
were been pinned in place, why it
was bleeding, why it was
whimpering...
Of course, by the time the police
finally bothered to turn up there was
nothing to show them. The woman
had been taken when I went out to
greet them leaving only one more
bloodstain.
I got a caution for wasting police
time. Serves me right.
The next day I got a call from the
owner. The second and last time I
ever heard his voice. He asked me if I
was still happy working at the Hilltop
Centre. He asked me if there was
anything I wanted to know. He asked
me where my daughter liked to shop.
I was never curious again. Even
when I found the owner dead in his
office, with every blood vessel
stripped from his body and strung
around the room in a grim cat's
cradle. I just closed the door and
kept cleaning and the pay slips kept
coming.
I try to take time off. Holidays are
important. If you're here too long,
too regular, you start to feel like
you're a part of the place. Like it's
getting inside you, making you a
fixture... That's when I take the
caravan and get some space.
Remind myself of the world. Because
at the end of the day, it's just a job.
But I still dream of the Hilltop. In my
dream, it waits for me, silent, grey
and eager for my company. Its
concrete bones are streaked through
with blood, like rippled ice cream
and I reach out for it. It's soft and
cold and yielding and then the gritty
mixture snakes up my arm and
begins to harden. It pulls me onward,
scraping off skin and tearing muscle,
until I finally fall...
The Custodian falls to the floor as parts of him begin to turn to
concrete.
CUSTODIAN (CONT'D)
It is rough and cold and silent inside.
The world is locked away and when I
open my mouth to scream... the cold
grey pours down my throat... and it
fills my stomach with stone, fills my
lungs with gravel and my blood... my
blood...
He is almost fully transformed.
CUSTODIAN (CONT'D)
We are the hilltop. It is me and I am it
and we are. We are...
He is gone.
#### 8. INT. HILLTOP CENTRE RETAIL UNIT 17 -- NIGHT, CLEAR
(SAM'S PHONE)
Sam and Celia pick their way through the detritus of the
abandoned space. Sam flicks a light switch a couple of times.
#### SAM
The lights are gone.
#### CELIA
So use your phone.
#### SAM
Oh yeah.
Sam turns on his phone's torch and makes a noise of
discomfort.
#### CELIA
Alice?
#### SAM
Seventeen missed calls.
#### CELIA
Yeah. You going to call her back or...
#### SAM
She can wait. Besides I want to look
around.
#### CELIA
There's not much to see.
#### SAM
Yeah... They must have completely
cleared it out.
#### CELIA
If they were ever here in the first
place.
Pause. Celia continues picking her way through the building.
#### SAM
Maybe we shouldCELIA
There it is.
CELIA begins pulling away some heavy broken shelving
revealing a door behind it.
#### SAM
You've got something?
#### CELIA
Stairs, to the basement.
Sam comes over and joins her.
#### SAM
Great spot! Well...
(dubious)
After you...
#### CELIA
And they say chivalry's dead.
#### SAM
Look, last time I went into a
basement I accidentally released a
monster so...
#### CELIA
Come on.
CELIA leads the way down the dark stairway. As they descend
there is a growing glassy tone and their voices begin to slightly
distort.
#### SAM
Do you hear that?
#### CELIA
I hear it.
They enter the basement. The tone is steady and louder now,
there is also a slight wind, as though they were standing at the
top of a precipice.
Pause.
#### SAM
(awestruck)
Do you see that?
#### CELIA
(quiet)
Yeah. I see it.
#### SAM
What is it?
Celia doesn't respond.
SAM (CONT.)
(fascinated)
Look how it splits the light... like a
prism... It's so... /Beautiful...
#### CELIA
(simultaneous)
/Dangerous.
Beat.
#### SAM
Celia... do you know what this is?
#### CELIA
Almost.
Beat.
#### SAM
Wait, what does that mean?
#### CELIA
It's complicated.
#### SAM
(impatient)
Then simplify it.
Beat.
#### CELIA
Sam, listen...
#### SAM
(finally snapping)
For gods sake, Celia! Enough! Okay?
I'm sorry but enough! I know you
want your privacy but we're way too
deep for that now! My head's killing
me, I'm staring at god-knows-what
and there's some... creature on its
way to record us to death or
whatever, so enough! No more
mysteries, no more cryptic clues and
weird half-truths, just for once I want
to know what the hell is actually
going on!
Beat.
CELIA (she sighs)
It's a wound in the world. A tear
between here and... where I came
from. And it wants me back.
#### SAM
What are you saying?
#### CELIA
It's unbalanced.
#### SAM
What?
#### CELIA
The institute, alchemy, all of it. It's all
about balance. Dua prima, four
elements, seven planets, it's all the
same. You've got to keep things
balanced. And if something is
missing, if someone is misplaced,
the equation doesn't balance... and
that's when things get bad...
#### SAM
Bad how?
#### CELIA
(ignoring the question)
...it keeps pulling me back. Closer
and closer. It won't let me stay...
#### SAM
But you don't want to go back.
#### CELIA
(somber)
I don't remember much of how I got
here. But I know there's nothing left
to go back to. Here I have a life. I
have Jack. He needs me.
Beat.
#### CELIA
(cont.)
I have to balance it. For him.
#### SAM
(suspicious)
What are we doing here Celia?
Beat.
#### SAM CONT.
(realizing)
All this digging, the O.I.A.R., The
Magnus Institute, you just want to
get me here... to make me trust you
so that what, you could just use me
to pay off some kind of cosmic debt?
#### CELIA
It was your idea to come here
tonight.
#### SAM
Was it?
#### CELIA
I'm sorry Sam.
#### SAM
So it was all a lie...
#### CELIA
(quietly)
Not all of it. I really did like you.
Beat.
#### SAM
So what's the problem?? We're here,
Alice won't make it in time and I
know you're carrying that knife.
What happens now? You push me?
Stab me? Or do I need to jump in
myself? Come on, what's stopping
you?
Beat.
#### SAM
(cont., softer)
What's stopping you Celia?
#### CELIA
I... I don't...
(her tone changes)
I don't- when I first awoke I knew
nothing, nothing but the dream of
things that sliced my who from me
with claws like scalpels...
She hesitates, fighting the compulsion.
#### SAM
Oh god.
A tape player switches on and our perspective violently shifts
into it as THE ARCHIVIST descends the stairs towards them.
#### CELIA
(still fighting it)
They would hunt me and toy with
what it meant to be me peeling away
my layers first my name, then my
memory and then...
#### SAM
Get away from her!
#### ARCHIVIST
#### AT LAST. IT IS MINE.!
#### CELIA
...and then the fearless one reached
in and grasped me, tore me out,
leaving my story to fall away like
autumn leaves...
#### SAM
I said leave her alone!
He charges the Archivist as it swells. They struggle. As they do
a sudden burst of wind sweeps through the room accompanied
by a deafening swell in the glassy tones and then... click.
#### 9. EXT. THE HILLTOP CENTRE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (ALICE'S
PHONE)
The taxi pulls over and Alice steps out.
#### TAXI DRIVER
(from inside)
This is it.
#### ALICE
(hurriedly)
Cool.
#### TAXI DRIVER
And like I told the others, there's
nothing here so if you want me to
hang aroundALICE is already running towards the Hilltop Centre.
#### ALICE
(calling)
Sam! Celia!
It is utterly silent. Alice keeps moving.
ALICE (CONT'D)
(calling)
Celia! Sam! Sam!
Still nothing. She spots something on the ground.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Oh god. Oh god no please...
She keels beside the concrete remains of THE CUSTODIAN.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Sam is thatCUSTODIAN
(a croaked whisper)
Rough... and cold... and silent and
whole... We are the hilltop... We are
the hilltop... We are...
Alice starts to back away.
#### ALICE
Nonononono. Not again.
She gets he her feet and starts running again.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Sam! Celia!
#### 10. INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, THUNDERSTORM
(MANAGER'S LANDLINE)
Gwen is poking around Lena's office. She opens a draw and
pulls out a bottle.
#### GWEN
(to herself)
Lena! You dark horse...
She pulls out a glass tumbler and unstoppers
the bottle. It sounds strong, and expensive.
She pours herself a large measure.
The phone rings. She hesitates for a moment then hits the
speakerphone button.
#### GWEN
Uh... This is the O.I.A.R., Bouchard
speaking.
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
Oh hello Gwen, just who I was after.
#### GWEN
(she sits behind the desk
flustered)
Oh! that's uh.. that is to say, what
can I do for you, minister?
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
I'm guessing since it's you picking
up that you've spoken with Lena
then?
#### GWEN
Oh, yes.. She, uh, she left.
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
Didn't make too much of a scene, I
hope? Difficult business, after all.
#### GWEN
Oh no, not at all.
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
Great. In that case, congratulations
are in order! I'm sure you'll do a fine
job.
Beat.
#### GWEN
I'm sorry?
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
I'll get someone to put the paperwork
across your desk first thing
tomorrow and make it official but I'm
not one to stand on ceremony. As far
as I'm concerned you're the
ringmaster now.
Pause.
TREVOR HERBERT(CONT'D)
(speakerphone)
Gwen? Are you still there?
#### GWEN
Yes, yes still here! So... What do you
want- What should I do?
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
Oh, don't worry about me, I'll stay
out of your way, I've never been one
to micromanage. You have my full
support.
#### GWEN
Right.
#### TREVOR HERBERT
(speakerphone)
Anyway, I won't keep you.
Congratulations again and, er, best
of luck!
TREVOR hangs up. Gwen stands there silent and unsure.
#### GWEN
Huh...
11. INT. UNIT 17 BASEMENT -- NIGHT, CLEAR (CELIA'S PHONE)
Celia is collapsed on the floor. There is no other sound save for
the tones of the rift and even that sounds quieter, more
balanced.
A door opens upstairs.
#### ALICE
(distant)
Sam? Celia?
Celia rouses slightly.
#### CELIA
Alice?
(calling)
Alice! Down here!
Alice moves through the upstairs and quickly finds the staircase
door and heads down it while Celia raises herself.
#### ALICE
Celia! Where's Sam? We've got to
get out of here. That archivist thing,
it followed you, it might beShe stops, taking in the scene before here.
ALICE (CONT'D)
What- What is that? What happened?
Alice realizes Celia is alone.
#### ALICE
Where's Sam?
There is a long pause.
#### CELIA
It attacked us. He tried to stop it, to
protect me even though...
She takes a shuddering breath.
#### CELIA
They fell into... They're gone, Alice.
Beat.
#### CELIA
They're gone.
