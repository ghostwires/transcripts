#### ANNOUNCER
This episode is dedicated to
Nathaniel Shawver -- Fear has shaped
my perspective and actions for so
long, but the immersive descriptions
of the fears in Magnus showed me
that I can choose to accept what I
Fear as part of myself rather than
feeling shame. There is so much in
this world to be afraid of, but in
examining that Fear we can find
wonder.

Protocol.
Episode Twenty-Eight -- Interruptions
##### [Music]
1. INT. OIAR OFFICE -- NIGHT, RAINING (COMPUTER)
SAM, CELIA and ALICE are sat typing (or at least, pretending to
type). LENA enters, followed by TREVOR HERBERT MP and
#### GWEN
#### LENA
And here, minister, is the main
office, where the majority of the
processing takes place.
#### TREVOR
So I see.
#### GWEN
And this is Sam, Alice and Celia our
primary processing team.
Trevor goes round, they all awkwardly stand and shake his
hand.
#### TREVOR
Good to meet you.
#### SAM
Uh, thank you, minister.
#### TREVOR
Fine work.
#### ALICE
Mmm. Cheers.
#### TREVOR
Lovely toHe is cut off by a massive yawn.
#### TREVOR
Pardon me, sorry. I honestly don't
know how you manage to get
anything done on such late shifts.
#### CELIA
You get used to it.
#### TREVOR
Clearly, but it does seem
unnecessary...
#### LENA
(jumping in)
The data processing and
amalgamation tools are locked into a
24-hour cycle. The crawlers scrape
online sources during the day then
once the nationals pre-publish the
data is incorporated into the
caseloads meaning we're locked into
this schedule. We could amend the
system, but the required
infrastructure overhaul would be
very expensive andTREVOR
Best leave it as it is I think. If it isn't
broken don't fix it eh?
#### ALICE
(muttered)
Ha...
#### TREVOR
Besides I wouldn't want to upset
your Team dynamic. And such a
diverse team it is too... I wonder if
we should get in a photographer, put
you all on some civil service
promotional material.
#### LENA
(slightly strained)
Oh I doubt that won't be necessary,
minister. We're hardly the most
interesting department.
#### TREVOR
Oh well, I don't know about that.
So anyway, uhGWEN
(quietly)
Sam.
#### TREVOR
Sam! How are the er accidentGWEN
(quietly)
Incident.
#### TREVOR
-incident numbers looking? Going
down, I hope!
#### SAM
Uh...
#### LENA
Our numbers have been steadily
improving ever since you took
charge, minister. It's all detailed in
my reports.
#### TREVOR
Glad to hear it. The ONS has been
sniffing around again, same old
rubbish about overlapping
responsibilities and “synergistic
fulfillment objectives”
#### LENA
Well hopefully our latest metrics
should assuage any concerns in that
department.
#### TREVOR
Just as long as it keeps GormanSmith off me back...
He yawns again.
#### LENA
Was there anything else you wanted
to see, minister?
#### TREVOR
No, no, no, I think we can move on.
#### LENA
Excellent. Gwen?
#### GWEN
If you'll follow me minister.
Trevor, Lena and Gwen leave. There is a moment of silence.
#### CELIA
Was that it?
#### ALICE
Oh for f-[ucks sake]
The recording stops.
#### 2. INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, RAINING (MANAGER'S
LANDLINE)
LENA enters with Gwen and Trevor. She sits behind her desk
while Gwen stands awkwardly.
#### LENA
Thank you very much for joining us
this evening, minister. I do hope it
met your expectations.
#### TREVOR
Mmmm.
#### LENA
Something the matter, minister?
He takes a deep breath as if to enter a pre-prepared speech,
which it is.
#### TREVOR
Look, Lena, I've know you've had a
lot of leeway running of this
department with previous ministers
and god knows I prefer a hands-off
approach[6]
#### LENA
Glad to hear it.
#### TREVOR
But it's reached the point where I am
forced to intervene.
#### LENA
May I ask why?
#### TREVOR
Because I am hearing from reliable
sources that one of your
subcontractors has been implicated
in a recent death, possibly even as a
murder suspect.
Beat.
#### LENA
Gwen can I ask you to wait outside
please.
Gwen starts moving to the door slowly.
#### LENA CONT.
Minister, if I may, we both know that
the rumor mill surroundingTREVOR
Skip it. I went to Eton with Daniel
Turner, the Commissioner. He keeps
me in the loop.
#### GWEN
(hand on the door handle)
Do you know which, uh,
subcontractor it was?
#### TREVOR
I'm sorry, do you hire a lot of
murderers for contract and
consultancy work?
#### LENA
(intervening)
She simply means that outside of
their specific work with us we don't
keep close track of our external
workers and hadn't been made
aware of this.
#### TREVOR
So you're telling me you know
nothing about an OIAR external
contract being found with the bodies
of two tattood thugs who met rather
grisly ends?
Gwen and Lena realise he's talking about Ink5oul. Trevor
doesn't notice.
#### LENA
I'm afraid not.
#### TREVOR
Then you're either lying or woefully
out of touch. Neither fills me with
confidence.
#### LENA
MinisterTREVOR
I was able to talk to Danny and keep
this quiet for now but I need to know
that there's no liability here, either
legal or, uh, reputational.
#### LENA
You have my absolute assurances
thatTREVOR
No. Not good enough. I need
someone's head to roll, so if it does
come back to bite me I can say that
those responsible have been
removed from their post.
#### GWEN
W-who would that be?
#### LENA
Gwen, outside.
GWEN doesn't move.
#### TREVOR
If you can find out who that contract
came from then fire them
otherwise...
#### GWEN
Otherwise?
#### LENA
Gwen.
#### TREVOR
Otherwise, I leave it to your
discretion.
#### LENA
(pointed)
I'll see what I can do.
#### TREVOR
Good. Now if you'll excuse me, it's
very late.
3. OIAR BREAKROOM -- NIGHT, RAINING (CCTV)
SAM, ALICE and CELIA are stood around, drinking coffee and
laughing.
#### CELIA
Good grief.
#### ALICE
I told you. I told you.
#### SAM
You did.
#### ALICE
But you didn't believe me, did you?
Oh no! You all thought “oh, Alice is
joking, she's exaggerating, she's
indulging in touch of comic
hyperbole-”
#### CELIA
I admit I was... skeptical.
#### ALICE
But I was right wasn't I? I. Was.
Right.
#### CELIA
I was sure he'd at least have a vague
idea about what we did. Just, like,
the faintest inkling.
#### SAM
At least this way we don't need to
talk to him.
#### ALICE
Oh, that's not very fair, Sam. Not
when he was so keen to spend time
chatting with such a diverse group of
folks.
#### SAM
Oh my god, I almost forgot!
#### ALICE
I personally love to be diverse and
think they should absolutely send a
photographer down to capture me
diversing all over the place.
#### SAM
(laughing)
Ew.
#### ALICE
What about you, Celia? You feeling a
little diverse?
#### CELIA
Oooooh I dunno. Does being a
woman still count?
#### ALICE
I mean, it's hardly centrefold of Civil
Service Weekly.
#### CELIA
Pan?
#### ALICE
I mean it's better. Are you from
anywhere particularly exciting? That
might do it.
#### CELIA
You have no idea...
#### ALICE
Ah of course, I forgot your
mysterious origins.
The good humour fades a little.
#### ALICE
(cont'd)
Anyway, I reckon Gwen and Lena are
going to be cleaning up after Mr.
“minister” for a while yet, so I'm
gonna bounce.
#### CELIA
Bit early isn't it?
#### ALICE
(Standing and grabbing her
stuff)
I've earned it. Besides, I'm grabbing
some drinks with Teddy.
#### SAM
In the morning?
#### ALICE
Ask not for whom the insomnia tolls,
my dear. Cover for me if Lena asks?
#### SAM
Always.
#### ALICE
Alright. Peace!
Alice leaves. Beat.
#### CELIA
Well, we should probably be heading
back to work.
Sam reaches out to her.
#### SAM
Wait a second.
#### CELIA
What's up?
#### SAM
I know you value your privacy and I
respect thatCELIA
Good.
#### SAM
But at some point you're going to
need to stop deflecting anytime your
past comes up. Don't get me wrong,
it's your business, you don't need to
tell me anything you don't want to
but... I can only get so close with
you when you keep so...
#### CELIA
So...
#### SAM
...locked down.
#### CELIA
Right.
#### SAM
All I ask is you think about it.
#### CELIA
I will.
#### SAM
Take your time, I'm in no rush and
like I said, if you decide you don't
want to share then I won't pry.
#### CELIA
Good to know.
#### SAM
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go
check what car the right honorable
dickhead is picked up in. Alice bet
me a tenner it's going to be a
Bentley.
#### CELIA
You're lucky you didn't bet more.
#### SAM
I know right? See you in there.
#### CELIA
Sure.
SAM exits. Celia remains.
#### 4. OIAR MAIN ENTRANCE EXT. -- NIGHT THUNDERSTORM
(GWEN'S PHONE)
TREVOR HERBERT MP is getting in his Bentley as the storm
grows thunderous. GWEN walks up behind him beneath an
overwhelmed umbrella.
#### TREVOR
-complete bloody shambles. Home,
Wilson before anyone else-.
#### GWEN
Uh, minister?
#### TREVOR
Oh, right, hello, uh...
#### GWEN
Gwendolyn. Bouchard.
#### TREVOR
Boucha- Not Jeremy's
granddaughter?
#### GWEN
That's right.
#### TREVOR
Ha! Right, I see the resemblance
now. How is the old bastard?
#### GWEN
He's all right, I think. We haven't
spoken in a few years.
#### TREVOR
(trying to duck into the car)
I see. Well, I wouldn't say it's been a
pleasure but it's good to know
there's at least one person here with
some quality.
#### GWEN
Thank you minister. Actually, I was
wondering if I could talk to you for a
moment.
#### TREVOR
(reluctantly)
Well you have my office number, so
you just call up and the admin girls
willGWEN
Lena's lying to you.
Beat.
#### TREVOR
(suddenly focused)
About what? This contractor
business?
#### GWEN
It happened because she made a
mistake. And it's not the first time
either. Here.
She hands him a flash drive.
#### GWEN
I've compiled a dossier of
confidential files stretching back
almost twenty years detailing Lena's
incompetence and malfeasance as
head of the OIAR. It's all on this
drive.
#### TREVOR
And how exactly did you happen to
stumble across these “confidential”
files?
#### GWEN
They were sent to me by a...
concerned third party who wishes to
remain anonymous.
#### TREVOR
I see. These are serious accusations.
#### GWEN
I'm aware.
#### TREVOR
Very well. Thank you for bringing
this to my attention Ms. Bouchard.
Good to see the apple hasn't fallen
far from the tree.
#### GWEN
Oh, yes. Thank you.
TREVOR gets into the car.
#### TREVOR
This is my direct number.
(he hands her a card)
Don't bother with the office, I'm
never there. You see anything else
“malfeasant” you give me a call.
He goes to close the car door.
#### GWEN
Understood.
#### TREVOR
I'll be in touch.
He shuts the door and the car pulls away leaving Gwen standing
in the rain. She takes a deep, steadying breath.
5. EXT. OIAR -- NIGHT, THUNDERSTORM (TAPE RECORDER)
A tape recorder clicks on in the rain. SAM opens the main door
and stands in the doorway.
#### SAM
(getting soaked)
Oh Christ! Alright, Trevor Herbert
MP, what do you drive...
He sees the car driving off.
#### SAM
(cont'd)
Ah, dammit.
He notices Gwen.
#### SAM
(cont'd)
Gwen?
(calling)
Gwen!
He takes a step forward.
The door slams shut behind him.
#### SAM
(cont'd)
Dammit!
He bangs on the door a couple of times.
There is a deep indrawn breath near the recorder which SAM
doesn't notice.
#### SAM
(cont'd)
Brilliant. Absolutely- The first time I
ever heard of the Magnus Institute
was from my parents.
He stops gasping for breath confused.
There is another indrawn breath beside the tape deck.
#### SAM
(compelled)
I remember they were beaming, full
of pride and satisfaction as they read
out the letter: “selected to apply for
our gifted child program”.
He again gasps for breath panicking.
THE ARCHIVIST emerges.
#### ARCHIVIST
#### MORE.
#### SAM
(fighting it)
I... Was... so happy... that I had
pleased them, that I was what they
had wanted...ARCHIVIST
#### MORE.
#### SAM
...that I was... special...
The world recedes as Sam's statement is pulled from him
leaving only his voice and the Archivist's indulgent breath.
#### SAM
I was so excited. It was my first ever
train trip alone. Alone apart from
Saul and Joy, the two other children
invited from my school and Mrs Leng
who was supervising us for the trip
to Manchester.
The journey from London was
magical. A whole two days off school
with nothing to prepare or study or
revise since the Institute wouldn't
say what kind of tests we were going
to be doing. I talked about Spiderman with Saul on the way and
compare pogs, although the train
was too bumpy to actually play. Joy
wanted to play as well, but she was a
girl and that was big deal. I still feel
bad for that but it wasn't like we were
mean to her or anything.
The thrill of the journey vanished the
moment we arrived at the Magnus
Institute. My school and the estate I
grew up on were both built in the
sixties, all decaying concrete and
decayed optimism, but this, this felt
old like I had only seen in movies. I
had learned a new word that week.
Austere. This felt austere. And as we
stepped into the building's shadow,
tried to hang back, so Mrs. Leng had
to gently pull me by the sleeve to get
me to go in.
It smelt funny, sort of like my local
library but more proper and the tall,
barred windows let in little light. The
place weighed on me like a heavy
winter coat.
We were met at the entrance by a
man called Gilbert. He was very thin,
with mousy brown hair and a
youngish face even though he
dressed like a headmaster. He spoke
with a big fake smile, like a kid's TV
presenter and led us into a large
room full of big chairs and old sofas,
which was packed full of other kids.
It seemed so strange to me that such
a grand room would be filled with so
many screaming, running children
and I think all the adults felt the
same. Gilbert left as quick as
possible after showing us in.
I was one of the first to be tested,
and I was especially nervous when I
met the pair of stern-looking older
women. They looked me up and
down with thin lips and arched
eyebrows, and I felt like I'd already
failed without even taking the test.
They sat me down on a carved
wooden chair that was far too big for
me, my feet dangling over the edge
uncomfortably. Then they began to
ask me questions. But not like I was
expecting at all. It wasn't maths or
reading or history or science it was
more like when I was sent to the
school nurse in year two after biting
another kid in an argument. “Was I
happy at home?”, “What do I do
when I feel angry or upset?”, “When
is it okay to lie?”
I answered as best I could, but the
women looked unhappy and it felt
like I was getting it all wrong and I
started feel cold and small and
stupid. Then I started to cry.
I couldn't help it. I knew I shouldn't,
that I was messing it up but all the
bad feelings that had been growing
inside since we arrived just burst
out. The women looked even more
annoyed and so I leapt out of the
chair, still crying and ran out of the
room before they could yell at me.
I ran and ran through the winding
corridors, with no idea where I was
going or what I was going to do. I
didn't want Mrs. Leng to see me like
this and tell my parents I'd been bad,
but I didn't want to be on my own in
this strange, horrible building.
Finally, I stopped in a dark corridor
with no windows, no sign of the
overcast day outside. I was lost. I
was lost and I was alone and I was in
so much trouble. I had to find a
grownup.
So I started trying doors but they all
seemed locked. Then I turned a
corner and found an open door with
the name Dr. F Welling engraved on
a brass plaque and bright light
spilling out from the inside. I should
have known that the colour of the
light was wrong. I should have
known from the chanting inside that
this place wasn't for me. But I was
alone and I was afraid and I needed a
grownup.
There was an old man in a tweed suit
stood muttering in front of a table
and on the table was a person. I
couldn't see their face but they were
naked and pale and still. Beside the
table was a pile of weird machines
and strange shaped beakers
bubbling and hissing and whirring.
Large chunks of stone and metal
hung slowly twisting in the air and
the sickly yellow light seemed to
come from everywhere. I stepped
forward and spoke with my smallest
indoor voice:
“Hello?”
That was all I said. That was all. I
couldn't have known.
He wasn't expecting any interruption
and I could see the surprise run
through him, disrupting his
concentration and making him
stumble over his words for just a
moment. It was just a moment, but in
that moment the glass exploded the
rocks fell and the yellow light
vanished, sucked away as though
into him.
We were thrown from dazzling
brightness into deep darkness but I
could just make him out as he turned
towards me. He looked at me and
opened his mouth, and I cowered,
waiting for the yelling, for the
punishment, but no words came out.
He just opened his mouth wider and
wider as if to scream, then reached
out towards me.
But the flesh of his arm, the skin and
muscle, it didn't move. It was the
bones, the bones that pushed and
strained against from inside as
though there were a person trapped
inside a fleshy suit. His skin strained
for a moment, then erupted in a
spray of blood that swept across the
floor with a single drop landing on
my new Velcro shoes.
The skeletal arm flailed outwards
held together by a few dripping
ligaments and leaking that awful
yellow light from the joints. Then it
bent and reached back and dug its
bony fingers through the man's
clothes and into his chest, ripping
off a gorey chunk and hurling it to
the floor. In the silence of the room I
heard the wet slap of the meat on the
polished wooden floor and looking
up I could see in the man's eyes that
he could feel everything even though
he didn't make a sound.
I stood there, frozen in shock and
terror, and watched as the other arm
thrust itself free from its meat,
reached up and tore away his face in
a single swift yank to reveal the
ecstatic skull within. The last thing I
saw was it's dripping red smile
before I turned and bolted from the
room.
The thunderstorm slowly begins to return.
I don't remember much after that.
The stern ladies found me crying in a
corner and pulled me back to the
room with the other children. They
gripped me too tightly but I didn't
say anything. I never told anyone
what I saw. My parents just assumed
I was upset after being rejected from
the program same as them. They
were so disappointed, so sad to
realize that I wasn't Magnus Material.
Just me, nothing special. I couldn't
look at them but not just because of
the shame, but because whenever I
saw their faces I could see the
outline of their skulls beneath, still
grinning at me.
And now, I- I'm going back... to
find... find....
The sound of the thunderstorm comes back into focus as Sam is
finally overcome and slumps to the floor. The archivist steps
forward takes one last breath of Sam's memory then recedes
leaving the tape recorder to flounder in the rain and stop.
