"System Update"

Draft 3
#### PUBLIC FEED ANNOUNCEMENT
Hello everybody and congratulations on making it to the end of
the first Season of The Magnus Protocol!
Ahead of today's episode we thought it might be a good idea to
give everyone a rundown of what to expect during the hiatus
and what else we have going on in the meantime because, as
always, there's a lot. Like a lot.
Okay first things first, we have a bunch of bonus content
unlocked thanks to Kickstarter and Patreon backers so thank
you to everyone who contributed to our horrible silliness!
Today's episode is the first of our bonus hiatus content and
we're starting with the Epilogue for Season 1. This little addenda
to what you've already heard is canon and I'll be honest, pretty
important to listen to for the story, even if it isn't a full length
episode.
After this we have our first Fluff episode that we have
affectionately titled: “Plenty of Fish” Though technically canon,
it is absolutely not essential to the plot and is guaranteed
absolutely zero horror. Just a slice of O.I.A.R. life.
Then we have our first “What if” episode rather less
affectionately titled: “What if everyone just listened to Colin.”
This is non-canon and takes a look at how things would have
panned out in the story with one small but important change.
We'll leave you to guess what we changed in this one.
After this we have a whole host of additional content including
the Season 2 trailer and the release of our latest Rusty Fears
which you'll be able to vote on with the winner getting to help
write an episode of Protocol! We might even try to sneak in a
Q&A and some third party recordings if you're good.
After all this you can expect a return of The Magnus Protocol for
Season 2 in February 2025. We know that feels a long way off
but making this show as an absolutely monumental effort and as
fun as making it is, our staff have yet to volunteer to have their
weak fleshy bodies replaced by glorious chrome so we do
occasionally need a break. For now.
Outside of the main feed though its busy, busy, busy with the
Season 2 Premiere Preview on the way.
In terms of other bonus materials, don't worry, we are still
working on all of them we are just waiting on some third party
bits and bobs beyond our control. We'll update everyone on
each element as soon as we are sure things are locked in so be
sure to keep an eye on Kickstarter and Patreon updates.
Beyond that, I am happy to say final approvals on The Magnus
Archives TTRPG developed by Monte Cook games are complete
and stuff is looking very shiny and should be being printed in
enormous numbers as we speak!
In a similar vein many of you will already know that we have a
Magnus Protocol boardgame on the way developed by the team
behind the massively popular Coup, The Resistance and
Sherlock Files games. The fundraising for this project will be
starting soon so make sure you head over to
www.rustyquill.com/boardgame where you can register your
interest for when it goes live and get first dibs on early bird
goodies.
And if ALL that is still not enough for you, you greedy little
content goblin, don't forget we have an entire Network of shows
you can fill your boots on not to mention Neon Inkwell our inhouse sister Podcast where we showcase the brightest (and
darkest) new talent in Audio fiction including some familiar
names too.
Whelp, that's about everything for now apart from saying
Thankyou to everyone of you who helps make this possible and
hoping you enjoy today's episode. Or don't. It's happening to
you either way.

Season One Epilogue
##### [Music]
1. INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (LANDLINE)
GWEN sits in the big chair idly drumming her fingers on the
desk. The main office door opens outside, and she freezes.
#### GWEN
(cautious)
Hello? Lena?
Beat. Quiet footsteps.
GWEN very quietly stands and picks up a heavy desk ornament.
She heads over to the door.
Pause. Footsteps approach.
GWEN braces herself.
The door opens and someone steps inside.
#### ALICE
Lena we need to talkGWEN moves to strike only to pull up short realizing it is Alice.
#### ALICE
Ah!
#### GWEN
Ah!
ALICE shoves GWEN who stumbles backward dropping the
desk ornament.
#### GWEN
Oh for Christ sake AliceALICE
Gwen? What are you doing in here?
#### GWEN
(getting up)
I thought you were... someone else.
#### ALICE
Right.
(shaking it off)
Where's Lena? I need to talk to her.
GWEN walks slowly back to the desk, attempting to reassert
herself.
#### GWEN
Lena's gone.
Beat.
#### ALICE
(haggard and urgent)
Gone where?
#### GWEN
(starting to enjoy herself)
Who's to say?
#### ALICE
Stop pissing around Gwen, she's not
picking up her phone and this is
important!
#### GWEN
Well then, I can't wait to hear itALICE
Gwen-
#### GWEN
-since I'm in charge now.
#### ALICE
(thrown)
I- You what?
#### GWEN
You heard. Lena's been let go on
multiple counts of negligence,
incompetence, possibly even
corruption.
#### ALICE
This isn't a fucking joke, Gwen!
Sam's...
She can't say it.
#### GWEN
(starting to become
concerned)
What?
Beat.
#### GWEN
Sam's what, Alice?
#### ALICE
(breaking)
I don'tBeat.
#### ALICE CONT.
He and Celia, they found a- thing and
one of your externals was there and
they...she says he...
Beat. Alice cries.
#### GWEN
(quiet)
Dead?
#### ALICE
No! ...Maybe. No -- I don't know!
#### GWEN
You're not making sense Alice.
Where's Celia? I'll ask her myself.
#### ALICE
She went home. She needed to be
with her baby.
Pause. Alice is exhausted and overwhelmed.
#### GWEN
You're serious, aren't you?
Beat.
#### GWEN CONT.
...I don't know what to say.
#### ALICE
No. You don't.
#### GWEN
So, what do we do?
#### ALICE
Well, I was going to talk to Lena, but
apparently, it's just your useless ass
here.
#### GWEN
(enraged)
Excuse me? I am notALICE
(defeated)
Save it.
Beat.
#### GWEN
Look, I'll admit, this is still very new
to me, do you know if Lena had any
sort of documentation for this sort of
thing?
#### ALICE
What?
#### GWEN
You know, like a guide, a manual,
That sort of thing?
#### ALICE
(exhausted)
No. I don't think she had a manual
for this.
#### GWEN
I just need something that explains
her role, the procedures...
#### ALICE
(so f***ing done)
Gwen. Please, just stop.
#### GWEN
Look, I know this is hard but Lena
must have had a contingency for
something like this. I mean, look how
quickly she dealt with Colin. All we
need to do isALICE
(leaping up)
Oh shit! Colin!
She pulls out her phone.
#### GWEN
Jesus it got Colin too?
#### ALICE
(calling him)
What? No. He called me, just beforeHe sounded in a bad way and then,
with everything, I just- I never called
him back.
#### GWEN
Fine, just make it quick. We've got
enough on our plate withoutColin's phone rings distantly in the main office. It is an
uncharacteristically upbeat tune.
Beat.
#### GWEN
Is that...?
#### ALICE
Colin...
Beat. The ringtone continues.
#### GWEN
Maybe he came in to do some work?
#### ALICE
He wasn't out there when I came in.
#### GWEN
Maybe he just left his phone here?
#### ALICE
He was getting weird about them...
But then how did he call me last
night?
The ringing stops.
#### ALICE
Voicemail.
She hangs up, then redials. The ringtone starts up again.
#### ALICE
Come on.
The two of them start following the ringtone.
#### 2. LONDON EXCLUSION ZONE -- NIGHT, CLEAR (TAPE
RECORDER)
The zone is quiet, though there is an oppressiveness to it that
makes it clear all is not well. Wind whistles through crumbling
ruins and occasionally the movement of unnatural things can be
heard in the distance.
The portal opens. It sounds very unpleasant, like a wet tearing of
reality, and SAM falls through with a cry, slamming into the
muddy ground.
He lies there for a few moments, trying to catch his breath, but it
won't come.
#### SAM
(weakly)
Wh-Where...
He collapses, unconscious.
3. OIAR SERVER ROOM -- NIGHT, CLEAR (COMPUTER)
The ringtone is much clearer, obviously in the same room now,
though it sounds like it might be inside of something.
The ringtone ends.
The door opens and ALICE and GWEN enter.
#### GWEN
You're sure it was in here?
#### ALICE
Pretty sure.
(calling)
Colin?
There is no answer.
#### GWEN
Maybe he's... hiding?
#### ALICE
Why would he be hiding?
#### GWEN
He's not supposed to be here,
remember? Not after the whole...
hammer thing.
#### ALICE
Well, his phone is, at least.
They begin to search.
#### GWEN
Anything?
#### ALICE
Nope.
They keep looking.
#### GWEN
Try calling again.
Alice calls again. The ringtone restarts.
#### GWEN
Over there....
They walk over to a server tower.
#### GWEN
(cont.)
You think he left his phone on a
server rack?
#### ALICE
Well I hardly think he's hiding inside
it do you?
Beat.
#### GWEN
Open it.
#### ALICE
(nervous)
You open it.
#### GWEN
Alice, I am your manager and Iam
telling you to open the- the thing.
#### ALICE
And I am telling you, not a cat-inhell's chance
#### GWEN
Oh for goodness sake must I do
everything myself?
Gwen grabs a server rack and yanks.
Beat.
The phone rings loudly and vibrates across the metal board.
#### ALICE
(quietly)
Oh Colin...
#### GWEN
What are youGWEN screams.
