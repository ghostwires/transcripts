##### [Show Theme -- Intro]
#### ALEX
Hello and welcome to episode 14 of the Rusty Quill Gaming podcast, we are
coming to you from London, England and I am Alex Newall, your host and GM,
and with me as always for better or worse, I have:
#### JAMES
James Ross.
#### BRYN
Bryn Monroe.
#### BEN
Ben Meredith.
#### LYDIA
Lydia Nicholas.
#### ALEX
And who are you playing?
#### JAMES
Sir Bertrand McGuffingham, half man, half man, half man.
#### BRYN
Sorry I'm distracted by the terrible maths (group laughter) I'm playing Hamid
the halfling sorcerer.
#### BEN
Zolf, a dwarven cleric of Poseidon.
#### LYDIA
Sasha, antiques appraiser and knife fancier.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
However given that we've just levelled in between weeks you're also a bit of a
bomb fancier if I understand?
#### LYDIA
Oooh yes.
#### JAMES
Just stroking a bomb under there.
#### LYDIA
Yeah I'm like a bomb whisperer 'alright, little bomb'. It's all about dominance
but in a situation of trust.
#### ALEX
Well you can't anger the bomb.
#### LYDIA
No.
#### JAMES
It's very important that one of you is in charge and you both know who that is.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### ALEX
And instead of...
#### JAMES
Stop worrying and love the bomb.
#### LYDIA
Stop worrying and love the bomb.
#### ALEX
And instead of a shoutout I'm going to tell everyone that I had my first jellied
eel (group cheering) I ate it yesterday, it was amazing.
#### LYDIA
They are delicious.
#### ALEX
I genuinely now actually recommend to everyone jellied eels as a thing.
#### JAMES
You big Cockney man.
#### ALEX
Oh they're great.
#### LYDIA
Did you like the jelly because as an actual Cockney, like, I still can't eat the jelly,
I really like the eel bit.
#### ALEX
I could eat the jelly but it was all about the eel for me.
#### LYDIA
It's all about the eel.
#### ALEX
It was all about the eel, I also reckon it would go well with mustard, so I think...
#### LYDIA
Yeah?
#### ALEX
So I think I called that in the episode earlier but to repeat yead we did do some
levelling up. I do still intend us to really have a talk about levelling up and
picking character routes and things but honestly between level one and level
two it's so very straightforward that it's just not worth your time.
#### BRYN
We'll done one for level three, maybe level four when it's interesting.
#### LYDIA
Speak for yourselves, guys, I got bombs.
#### ALEX
So Bryn if you can run through quickly sort of the default things that will
happen and then we'll go round and say what everyone got individually as an
extra.
#### BRYN
So I believe everyone's base attack bonus went up by one. (Group cheering)
Most people got an increase to a single save, we all obviously got a few hit
points. Some of us got lots of skill points, looking at Lydia, some of us got a
couple of skill points.
#### JAMES
I fell over.
#### BEN
Some of us got three.
(Group laughter)
#### BRYN
Yes.
#### ALEX
And that said obviously a couple of you got the chance to pick some feats or an
extra spell say things like that so I'm just going to go around quickly and just
get everyone to sort of talk to me about what you did when you levelled and
then we'll get into the game. So starting with, let's start with you, James.
#### JAMES
I took weapon focus bastard sword.
#### ALEX
Shocker.
#### JAMES
Exactly, it's just Bertie just staring at it for hours going, “Urrgghhh really
focused urrgghhh!”
#### ALEX
Yep and all that is doing is it's specialising sort of and it just makes you better,
it gives you a plus one bonus.
#### BRYN
Yeah plus one to hit with a bastard sword but as with many of Bertie's feats it
leads on to greater things in the future.
#### ALEX
And Bryn yourself?
#### BRYN
Well Bertie also got the class feature bravery.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah.
#### BRYN
Which means his terrible will save is not quite as terrible if someone is making
him afraid.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
If somebody is trying to terrify me I'm fine, if somebody has offered me
biscuits it's not going to go so well!
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
Sure, so yeah James obviously got bravery and moving onto you Bryn?
#### BRYN
I got precisely no class features, feats or abilities whatsoever. I got to add a
new zero level spell to my list of spells.
#### ALEX
Also known as a cantrip for people who were wondering.
#### BRYN
Yes cantrip.
#### JAMES
Don't worry Bryn you're already perfect.
#### BRYN
Ah. Thank you for lying so beautifully. I took read magic which again is
incredibly dull as a spell but occasionally useful.
#### ALEX
It's one of those ones that you really, really need to have and no one has ever
been enthused by read magic really.
#### JAMES
What does it do?
#### ALEX
It allows him to read magical spells that are written down.
#### JAMES
Oh. To be fair the clues were all there!
(Group laughter)
#### BRYN
One feels you could have worked that out.
#### JAMES
Yeah.
#### BRYN
You're the kind of person who walks into a kitchen and asks where the forks
are without checking the very obvious one and only drawer.
#### JAMES
Drawer, yep.
#### ALEX
Ben?
#### BEN
Again very similar I didn't do much, I got some extra slots because I work a
little bit differently as a cleric in that I have access to all orisons which is what
they call their zero level spells but to let people know I won't get it until I
mediate again but I'm going to be going with burning disarm for tomorrow
because that's quite good and spark is my orison.
#### JAMES
What does burning disarm do?
#### BEN
Makes a lump of metal really hot.
#### JAMES
Right.
#### ALEX
Makes you want to drop your things.
#### BEN
So you'll have to drop it.
#### LYDIA
Does it work for anything so like if I have like a stick?
#### BEN
It has to be a weapon, so any weapon that someone is holding or an
unattended lump of metal up to 15lb.
#### LYDIA
That's just sitting there! Unloved, its mum has left it.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
Can you use it to turn just something into a hot plate?
#### BRYN
I don't see why not.
#### BEN
No, no, no, it goes away for one, it goes away almost instantly it just heats up
for one round and then goes away again but you could maybe flash fry
something with it.
#### ALEX
And Lydia, yourself?
#### LYDIA
Um yeah, so I got some you know the hit points, I got twelve skill points but
I've just put them in the same slots I had so I'm just better at everything and
yeah I decided that after looking at all of the rogue...
#### BRYN
Incredibly long list.
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### LYDIA
Incredibly long list and there are so many things that I'm sure are like, it's so
complicated but I thought at the moment we're drowning in bombs and Sasha
likes making things so she is going to learn to make bombs.
#### ALEX
I'm not surprised that this is the way things went. To spell out for listeners by
the way rogues have a thing where their one of their features is they get to
pick a rogue talent, what that really is, is rogues have their own extra list of
feats sort of.
#### BRYN
They are not quite as powerful as feats but.
#### ALEX
But yeah they are slightly less powerful so what you end up with is rogues get a
lot of extra rogue talents, one of which is yeah you get bomb making and...
#### BRYN
It's a horrendous list though because not only is it incredibly long but some of
the options on it are picked from this other really long list.
#### LYDIA
Yeah I could take ninja tricks, there's alchemist-y thing.
#### BRYN
Isn't one of them just taking a combat feat?
#### LYDIA
Yes, yeah and I can get all combat feats.
#### BRYN
Which again is possibility the longest list of all.
#### ALEX
Yeah.
#### LYDIA
So a bomb I get three a day because it's my int bonus, it doesn't scale.
#### ALEX
It will scale when your int goes up but it doesn't sort of increase relative to.
#### LYDIA
Oh I didn't know the int went up?
#### ALEX
Yeah it can do if you were to say get some inherent bonuses, a God could come
along and go I really like you Sasha, I like the way you roll here's another plus
four to your int.
#### BEN
Basically butter Alex up and you'll get more stats.
#### LYDIA
Cool yeah and it does my sneak attack damage but I can throw it in people's
faces and I thought that would be nice.
#### BRYN
You also got the class ability evasion.
#### LYDIA
Oh yes, yes.
#### ALEX
Ooh that's a good one.
#### LYDIA
So I dodge stuff, I assume, or evade.
#### BRYN
Basically dodging fireballs and stuff if most people when they dodge
successfully still take half damage, you take none.
#### LYDIA
So I read that and I did not understand it, I thought that it was only if things do
half damage I get to avoid.
#### ALEX
No, no, no it's this brilliant thing where is Bryn's fireball accidently goes off and
deals you know 10d6 to everyone we always used to.
#### JAMES
One day.
#### ALEX
I always used to have it described to me as you enter rogue space, you sort of,
step sideways and then sidle out of the world for a couple of moments. The
explosion goes off and then you sidle back and...
#### BRYN
So basically you get to be Link?
#### ALEX
Sure yeah, yeah.
#### BRYN
What is it, Link Between Worlds?
#### ALEX
See I always, I always thought it was like the crawstep from the Nac Mac
Feegle in the Terry Pratchett books you just sort of do a little bit of a wiggle
and then you're out of the area for a while and then you come back, anyway.
#### LYDIA
What about listeners at home, do you have instances of people hiding behind
dimensional space?
#### ALEX
If you do get on our dedicated forum where we'll have a thread dedicated to
hiding in extra dimensional spaces.
#### LYDIA
Write it on a postcard, and just look at it.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
Right I think that's quite enough preamble. So we'll do a quick recap for
listeners at home but obviously the story is starting to get a bit longer so it's
going to be a bit of a fly by wire. The simulacrum was stolen and/or destroyed
later found to be definitely in bits, the party got sent back down into Other
London to find the people that did it via a quick sidestep through one of
Sasha's old friends who made a quick deal which Hamid potentially foolishly
accepted.
#### BRYN
I'm a halfling is there's a cursed magic ring we all know where it is going to be.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
So after...
#### BRYN
I'm just as beautiful as Elijah Wood!
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
On the inside!
#### LYDIA
Awww.
#### JAMES
I thought it was a more plausible claim, isn't he a movie star? I don't know I've
never seen the films.
#### BRYN
Like I meant in character.
#### JAMES
Oh.
#### BRYN
My character is explicitly beautiful.
#### ALEX
That's fine you just make valued comments on your co-stars James that's fine.
#### BRYN
James doesn't think I'm pretty.
#### ALEX
And the party got moved on to a compound which was by the Thames, for
some of you the first time you've ever seen the river because it just disappears
beneath the glut that is London and you guys manage to lure off a pair of
guards and their dogs.
#### JAMES
Lore? We dazzled them with our obscure knowledge.
#### BEN
Did you know, I didn't I will come with you.
#### BRYN
Yes sir.
#### JAMES
They call me the trivia whisperer. Pub quiz this way guys.
#### BEN
We're just Stephen Fry dazzling people with our general knowledge.
#### ALEX
In fairness Hamid did lure them with the lore of a statue they'd never seen.
#### BRYN
That's true.
#### ALEX
So they all came to investigate, found Bertie stood there all gold-ed up, all
glammed up.
#### JAMES
To be fair Bertie probably does look a bit like Stephen Fry, very tall, lots of
bottles, very keen on Apple products, supports Norwich City, like all of this.
Yeah it's all a back story it's only because they've got canaries, they're birds,
you see.
#### BRYN
True.
#### JAMES
Anyhow carry on.
#### ALEX
So you guys managed to ambush them successfully after having lost that fight
earlier in Other London so you managed to turn things around and you, you
really got the drop on these guys.
#### BRYN
I didn't even really, I literally didn't need to do anything, I had one action it was
I wait while the rest of you just slaughtered them.
#### ALEX
I like to think of it as a really calculated wait.
#### BRYN
Oh it was, oh, absolutely.
#### ALEX
So you Sasha, Zolf and then with Hamid playing good cop managed to
interrogate the remaining guard and find out that there are at least three
people inside and that the area had been trapped and also then Zolf had a little
bit of a share with everyone.
#### BEN
I revealed a troubling religious belief.
#### ALEX
Indeed, Zolf does have a thing about drowning people that he thinks deserves
it in the eyes of his God.
#### BEN
Yeah.
#### ALEX
I mean you know it's Poseidon, no one said he was nice.
#### BEN
Playing the executioner.
#### ALEX
Hmm a little bit, so the deal that you seem to have struck with the rest of the
party was that you would...
#### BEN
Leave these guys alone because they seemed reasonably not super-culpable
but definitely do it to their leader because he seemed like a real nasty person.
#### ALEX
So we're going to pick up exactly after that discussion between Zolf and Hamid,
you guys are at the pool with a couple of unconscious guards, a dog that's laid
out and ooh I forgot to mention...
#### JAMES
I've got a doggie. I've got a doggie. Bertie's got a doggie called Brutor, he's an
idiot and I don't have time to train him to do anything before this combat. I
wonder if he's just going to go off and have his own little adventures in the
corner as a comic subplot to the comic relief character during this combat.
#### ALEX
(Makes dog noises) I smell a spin off. Ok so let's pick up where we left off. Go.
#### LYDIA
I've got fourteen daggers, can you see like I've got fourteen.
#### JAMES
(Makes noises at Brutor)
#### LYDIA
Are you guys still?
#### BEN
No I think, I think that's resolved, right?
#### LYDIA
Fourteen
#### BEN
Are we good?
#### BRYN
For now.
#### BEN
For now.
#### BRYN
I guess.
#### BEN
But we're agreed?
#### BRYN
Yeah I think so.
#### LYDIA
Do you want a dagger?
#### BRYN
No thank you.
#### JAMES
Bertie runs back over. Hello again, chaps, right so hitting people with things,
shall we?
#### BEN
I think that's probably a good idea if we get down to business.
#### JAMES
Now any traps in the building ahead, young lady?
#### LYDIA
Well like that guy just said there would be traps.
#### BRYN
Yeah he said there would be three people and some traps.
#### LYDIA
And like of them can do magic and stuff.
#### BEN
Yeah I think he said the leader is a guy who might do magic, shouldn't be too
much of a problem.
#### BRYN
I hope not.
#### LYDIA
So do you want to, we could go around the back, that's how I usually get in.
#### BEN
We've taken out the perimeter guys that was the entire point so we can just
wander up.
#### LYDIA
Right.
#### BRYN
I think just the front gate I mean some you can climb really well some of the
rest of us can't. I look pointedly at the two men in large armour one of whom
has one leg.
#### JAMES
I'm very good at trying.
#### LYDIA
Alright well you do your statue thing we'll wheel you through the front gate.
#### BEN
What a statue delivery?
#### JAMES
You three could hide inside me and then when they go to open me, woah
adventurers.
#### LYDIA
It worked surprisingly well last time.
#### BEN
I think surprising is the operative word there so I think we discussed sending
you in first to deactivate the traps.
#### LYDIA
Right.
#### BEN
Not to do any confrontation.
#### LYDIA
Loving this plan yeah.
#### BEN
Bearing in mind that I'm not particularly quite in my movements nor is Bertie
so.
#### JAMES
Bored now, and Bertie then marches off in the direction of the front gate,
relatively slowly but he's still definitely marching off in the direction of the
front gate.
#### BEN
I don't, Bertie, Bertie, come.
#### BRYN
I think that's the right idea. I scamper after him.
#### LYDIA
I'll just make sure like I look at Zolf like “these idiots” and then run quietly but I
am faster than them.
#### JAMES
Going off to hit some things, going off to hit some things.
#### BRYN
Just wait outside the front gates while Sasha gets rid of any of the traps, you
don't want to explode accidentally.
#### JAMES
No, no, no.
#### LYDIA
I want to run up to the front, the side of the wall on the outside I'm explaining
this really badly but like basically flat against the wall and sneak up to the door
so that someone looking out over from the top would not see me.
#### ALEX
Yeah that's fine so you're pushing yourself up against the wall so that they
can't get a, a sort of line of sight.
#### LYDIA
Yeah, yeah and then so I assume that means I have to cover some ground but I
have covered that before.
#### ALEX
Honestly it's fine, we can skip to everyone is up against the wall and Sasha is
now making her approach to...
#### LYDIA
The door.
#### ALEX
To the main gate.
#### BRYN
The three of us should be at the corner while Sasha deals with the gate
probably.
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### LYDIA
Gonna detect some traps!
#### ALEX
Got for it, give me a perception roll.
#### LYDIA
Ah bad, ok, so that's five but plus my new additional... so that's I believe that's
- I can do maths -- twelve?
#### ALEX
Twelve, you detect no traps.
#### LYDIA
Oh dear.
#### BEN
It might just mean there are no traps.
#### LYDIA
Yeah it could.
#### ALEX
Oh the eternal, eternal quandary for all rogues everywhere.
#### LYDIA
Do I have anything long to prod at the door?
#### ALEX
Now you're talking about the thing that you might want to be looking at doing
is...
#### LYDIA
You want the rogue log, he keeps telling me to get a log.
#### ALEX
Well there's two things that all rogues will enjoy which is the 10ft pole for
poking things because you're fairly certain it's going to explode.
#### BRYN
It just leads to an arms race between trap manufacturers and pole
manufacturers. It's not economically worthwhile in the long run.
#### ALEX
And then the rogue log which becomes your new best friend where you just
roll it down corridors and see if things snap at it.
#### LYDIA
I feel like I do not have time to detect again so I guess I'm going to try and open
this door.
#### BRYN
You've got the key.
#### LYDIA
Yes with the key.
#### ALEX
Because you lifted it from one the guards yeah.
#### LYDIA
I did so I unlock the door and beckon them over.
#### ALEX
The door is unlocked.
#### LYDIA
Hooray!
#### ALEX
It doesn't explode.
#### BRYN
Hooray!
#### ALEX
And everyone becomes beckoned.
#### BEN
Hooray! I take the beckoned condition.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
Yes very good.
#### BEN
Yes I stump over.
#### ALEX
Ok so you're all now beside Sasha and the gate is open.
#### BEN
Lovely.
#### LYDIA
I peer round I guess, perception checks?
#### ALEX
Yeah if you can give me a perception check unless you want to do the Scooby
Doo thing of four heads poking around the gate the same time?
#### JAMES
'Boink, boink, boink, boink'.
#### LYDIA
I think we absolutely should.
#### BEN
We don't have the heights!
#### ALEX
Oh go on then.
#### BRYN
We are a nice distribution of heights.
#### BEN
Alright let's do, we're going to Scooby Doo it.
#### LYDIA
Shall we do it in order of height?
#### JAMES
Also, yes, and I'm only saying this because we've got a dog with us.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah Scooby is going to be looking around the door.
#### JAMES
Gonna be the Scooby gang.
#### ALEX
Yeah, yeah that's Scooby going.
#### BEN
Oh no, oh no, this has happened.
(Group laughter)
#### BEN
Who do I want to be? Daphne.
#### LYDIA
Does the dog get a perception check as well?
#### JAMES
I think the dog should have a perception check, whether it can then
communicate any useful information.
#### ALEX
The dog will be getting a perception check.
#### LYDIA
And if it...
#### BEN
If it yelps and runs away we're like oh.
#### LYDIA
So in order of height I think?
#### JAMES
Definitely me first.
#### ALEX
And it's definitely Bertie's dog with a roll of 2.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
My perception is five. So I can tell there are buildings.
#### ALEX
Yes there are.
#### JAMES
Yes I've done well.
#### LYDIA
Oh right me, ah twenty.
#### ALEX
Twenty.
#### LYDIA
Not a natural twenty.
#### ALEX
Yeah anyone else?
#### BEN
That will be on eighteen.
#### BRYN
Eighteen as well.
#### ALEX
Sure so everyone, Bertie yeah you see yeah there is a compound, “what have I
been told that there is a compound is true, there is a compound, it is here.”
Sasha and everyone else sees three buildings there is the hut which is long,
low, it appears to be narrow at this end it is longer than it is sort of wide and it
is made of wood and is on stilts, it's a fairly recent build. It looks like it has
actually been made fairly well and it wouldn't have taken a large group of
people to necessarily make it, maybe a bit of time. There are two other
buildings.
#### JAMES
How sturdy are the stilts?
#### LYDIA
(Laughter).
#### ALEX
No it's a fair point, certainly hackable, they are not heffing great logs but there
are multiple stilts so it's more a case of there are say twelve stilts holding it up
rather than four with big tree trunk things in each corner.
#### JAMES
Sure.
#### ALEX
There are two other buildings, one of which is immediately closest to the gate
on the left hand side, it appears to be in a very bad state of disrepair, it was
probably a two storey building. When you look at it in the context of the larger
building it becomes apparent that yeah it was probably a church and a
vicarage. The vicarage is the one that looks to be in very bad repair, most of
the upper floor has gone there's a bit so you could probably say go up there
and have a look around but it doesn't look like you could you know set up shop
there. The ground floor, we have some US listeners when I say ground floor I
mean the one on the ground floor, when I mean the one above that I mean
first floor. The larger building yeah appears to be a church on closer
inspection. You wouldn't have noticed it necessarily at first from a distance as
most of the steeple's gone but the church has two storeys and in addition has a
raised roof so there might be a loft in there or something similar but they
obviously are both larger than that hut.
#### BEN
I've got an idea guys so if Bertie goes for the hut with stilts, chops them down,
collapses it, causes a distraction while he's in the yard being big and covered in
armour they'll run out, try and do stuff, we run in take them from behind.
#### LYDIA
Why don't we set it on fire?
#### BEN
We could also do that but it makes less of a huge crash. What do we think?
You wanted to do something, you're bored, that would be exciting.
#### JAMES
Distractions you say.
#### BRYN
We should just attack them while they're not read, if they hear something
they'll get time to prepare and cast spells and grab bombs and all that kind of
thing. We should just get to them as quickly as possible.
#### BEN
'Actually that's a point, do you back in the market place didn't you get hold of
a bomb?'.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### BEN
So you could lob that from the window?
#### LYDIA
Well I don't have a bomb I have a vial fire flask.
#### ALEX
Sure so with the fire flask the one that you were throwing is a direct hit, it's not
a splash, it will do 1d6 of fire damage.
#### BRYN
Don't you still have the thunderstone?
#### LYDIA
Oh yes I do.
#### ALEX
You do have a thunderstone which is an area of effect but it will only deafen
them it will not deal actual physical damage.
#### BRYN
But it will confuse them and stop them casting spells.
#### LYDIA
Yes.
#### ALEX
It will interfere with spell casting, it doesn't silence the person but they do take
a significant penalty to try and make any kind of magic happen.
#### LYDIA
I think that would be a pretty good distraction yeah.
#### BEN
Alright so do you think we need to clear out the inside of the building outside
of that room first and disarm the traps in there so we can rush in or shall we...?
#### BRYN
It looks like they are on the second floor if we can just get to the bottom of the
stairs without tipping them off and you can throw a bomb inside.
#### LYDIA
So like I could... but then I need both places right because I need to undo the
traps and I need to climb up out the outside and throw the thing in?
#### BEN
We've got them by surprise, scout in, come back out and we'll head in and you
throw the bomb.
#### LYDIA
Sasha saves the day! I go into the front door.
#### BRYN
Well stick to the fence if we move slowly we won't tip them off, we'll stick to
the fence and we'll get to the door.
#### LYDIA
Stay out the way while I do the adventuring. Right so, because Sasha has been
told that there are traps here and she doesn't like getting exploded on and she
has seen big explosions she is going to take a perception check for every single
step but I think maybe that might take a while so how are we going to play
that?
#### ALEX
Yeah for a lot of, I've known game masters who would require you to search
every 5ft square and it makes...
#### JAMES
Who are these people?
#### ALEX
It makes me want to jump off bridges, let's not do that, what I'm going to do is
you have said I am being careful and watching out for traps so rather than
doing a roll of each one you can just effectively say yeah I'm taking into
account that if you run into something that you might run into I'll get you to do
a roll, what I will do though is I will get you to do a roll say for the journey
across and depending on that roll you wouldn't necessarily know... so if you got
a low number on the roll you wouldn't have even known that you passed the
trap, if you get a high number you know where that trap is do you see what I
mean? It would be like I would get you to roll to go across a minefield.
#### LYDIA
Right.
#### ALEX
If you rolled high you know where the mines are, if you don't roll high you
don't know where the mines are.
#### LYDIA
Ok.
#### ALEX
But it's still over a larger area, it is just to speed it up.
#### LYDIA
Oh ok right.
#### ALEX
Just ask one thing are you skirting the wall or are you going through the
middle?
#### LYDIA
I am skirting, oh yeah we're skirting the wall.
#### BRYN
We're skirting the wall.
#### ALEX
Ok that's fine then give me a single check to get up to the front door of the
church.
#### LYDIA
Oh it's still fifteen.
#### ALEX
Fifteen, sure, you skirt the wall, you do not encounter any traps, you do
however get a glance inside the smaller building, what we'll call the vicarage,
and it appears that there is some kind of stock pile of stuff in there, you can't
really see what.
#### LYDIA
Ah stuff.
#### ALEX
But.
#### BRYN
Later!
#### LYDIA
I think Sasha would have said that under her breath.
(Group laughter)
#### BRYN
I've got good perception, I have.
#### ALEX
Ok so you make it to the front doors of the church which are locked.
#### LYDIA
Ooh locked.
#### ALEX
I will get you to do another check to see if the doors are trapped.
#### LYDIA
Right, yes.
#### ALEX
Because now you are in.
#### LYDIA
Ooh so that's sixteen, I'm adding the one bonus now by the way.
#### ALEX
Yeah, yeah.
#### LYDIA
So that's...
#### ALEX
We should spell out, it was something I had mentioned earlier for listeners,
rogues also add half of their level to all checks for traps and half of their level
to all disable devices. It hasn't mattered before now but as Sasha continues to
level up it will matter more and more.
#### LYDIA
I should say that whilst it barely matters now I did realise when I was listening
back to them that in the first two episodes, close listeners at home might
notice that my perception went up by one in between episodes and it was just
because I was reading the wrong number.
#### ALEX
We'll just say you were drunk for the first two episodes.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### BEN
It's alright the way I've been dealing with my cleric stuff is, is a mess but I'm
going to get better so keep those angry emails to yourself.
#### JAMES
We're all just drunk all the time, guys. In case anybody is wondering, drinking
is cool and it will make you seem more popular and grown up.
#### ALEX
He said on the family friendly podcast. So Sasha searches for the traps and
gets...?
#### LYDIA
I do well... it was, I can do this it's sixteen.
#### ALEX
Sixteen, right, you detect a trap.
#### LYDIA
Yay.
#### ALEX
So as you approach the door you start carefully just sort of prodding the mud
in front.
#### LYDIA
I push everyone back.
#### ALEX
And you find that there is a loose flagstone on the top step and you discern
that it is definitely intentionally loose and we'll treat that as a trap.
#### BEN
Ooh it's a classic.
#### LYDIA
Ok do I just roll...
#### JAMES
Tripping hazard.
#### LYDIA
Disable device?
#### ALEX
Yes.
#### LYDIA
Ok. Oh gosh. Oh dear.
#### BRYN
We back up before she rolls.
#### LYDIA
Yeah so that's, it's a total of... wait I get another plus one on that as well don't I
so that's eleven.
#### ALEX
Eleven total. So as you go to disable device you start faffing with the stone.
#### LYDIA
Oh dear.
#### ALEX
And you start to feel something grinding underneath and given what you've
experienced before you're fairly certain that what they've done is propped a
very heavy stone directly on top of a thunderstone.
#### LYDIA
Ah.
#### ALEX
And the thunderstone is taking the weight of that stone so that if anyone trod
on it the thunderstone would crack and make a loud noise.
#### LYDIA
Ah ha.
#### ALEX
Unfortunately your roll wasn't high enough to disarm the trap.
#### LYDIA
Oh no.
#### ALEX
So as you reach down there is a (explosion) and the stone falls, it doesn't do
any damage to anyone, you're not deafened because it's underneath a stone
however it was a significantly loud noise.
#### LYDIA
Right oh dear.
#### ALEX
And almost certainly other people have heard that, all of the party definitely
heard a loud noise but you're not deafened by any stretch.
#### BRYN
When that goes off I will shout, chuck the bomb!
#### LYDIA
Right and I ok so I will try and throw the bomb through the window.
#### BRYN
First floor window.
#### LYDIA
In the first floor window.
#### BRYN
Roll initiative.
#### ALEX
I will let you throw the bomb before and then we will go into initiative. Ok?
#### LYDIA
Right so I'm lobbing it, it is directly, it is on the first floor.
#### ALEX
Is this throwing the thunderstone that you had or is this the fire flask?
#### LYDIA
This is the thunderstone.
#### ALEX
Give me an attack roll, make it good.
#### JAMES
Fifteen.
#### LYDIA
So that's fifteen and then.
#### ALEX
Ooh a total of, so your attack bonus?
#### LYDIA
Is one.
#### BRYN
The thrown... I've written that on your sheet now.
#### LYDIA
Four.
#### BRYN
Yeah.
#### ALEX
So it's...
#### BRYN
Nineteen.
#### ALEX
Nineteen total.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### ALEX
You successfully throw the thunderstone, it smashes through a second storey
window (smashing sound effect).
#### BRYN
Destroying some ancient and beautiful examples of stained glass.
#### ALEX
Oh of course it was incredibly valuable but you know wacka wacka wacka so
you throw the thunderstone in and there is a loud (explosion sound effect)
and all of the windows blow out.
#### LYDIA
Amazing.
#### ALEX
Showering glass, thankfully the angle that everyone has taken relative to the
vicarage means that you guys are safe from the showering glass and we will
then roll for initiative and while we do that we're going to take a couple of
minute break for the listeners and when you come back we will be ready to
start some combat.
#### LYDIA
Whoop, whoop!
##### [AD BREAK]
#### ALEX
And welcome back. So we now have taken all of our initiatives so we will start
with someone who isn't the party.
BEN and ALEX
Duh duh duh duhhh.
#### BRYN
Hopefully he's going oh I'm deaf.
#### ALEX
They've done their move, ok, can we start with Sasha?
#### LYDIA
I'm not going to be able to kick the door down so I want to climb up so
potentially to throw because you need to be able to aim the vial, the fire flask,
so yes climb up above the door.
#### ALEX
Sure in which case give me a climb check.
#### LYDIA
Right my climb is now four. So that's twenty three.
#### ALEX
Ooh grand, ok, it will take you a standard action to climb just because of the
nature of the building and so you would still have a move action if you want
but you cannot climb and throw in this turn.
#### LYDIA
Can I...?
#### BRYN
Your move action should be to draw probably.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### ALEX
What I would say as well is just for listeners we're not running into something
that everyone encounters at some point which is vertical game play in table
top games, there's one solution of course which is that you spend an
enormous amount of money and make a really, really high multi levelled thing
or...
#### LYDIA
Should I make a grid of wall?
#### ALEX
What yeah what I tend to do is I tend to make a separate floor map for a
second floor and for anyone who is raised above a normal map.
#### BEN
Plonk them on the dice.
#### ALEX
We put them on a dice.
#### EVERYONE
Ah.
#### ALEX
Ok so Sasha, she gets up, drawing her vile as her move action, her standard
action is to climb and sort of peep in through the blown out window. What she
sees is a room which is full of crates and some barrels.
#### LYDIA
Ooh stuff.
#### ALEX
Yeah definitely stuff and there looks to be a small contained cooking fire, a few
bunk beds and what looks like someone was in the process of cooking. All the
chairs are thrown back and the food has been dropped as you see two of them
are still pulling their wits togethers, one of them is already making it and
darting through the doorway at the far end of the building presumably to head
down some stairs to the ground floor. The room itself is very much half store
room, half living room, it looks like they may be very well equipped but it
doesn't seem like they are particularly luxurious surroundings with which they
have been living in. So Hamid you're up.
#### BRYN
I would like to ready an action, my action is to rush into the building once the
door has been opened, hopefully by Bertie.
#### ALEX
Is that your wording? You rush into the building once the door is opened?
#### BRYN
Yeah.
#### LYDIA
Aww Hamid.
#### BEN
Ooh it's like a genie's wish.
#### LYDIA
Yeah Hamid the hero.
#### BRYN
I, yeah not like rush fully, like just rush in just one step inside the door that's all
I mean that's all the movements people have had anyway.
#### ALEX
I'm going to throw you a bone. Potentially you may want to clarify if one of
your party opens the door.
#### JAMES
I was going to say follow me I think might be the.
#### BRYN
Yeah ok that's thank you.
#### ALEX
So if a party member opens the door you step through it?
#### BRYN
Yes.
#### ALEX
That's fine.
#### BRYN
And I'll load my crossbow as I go.
#### ALEX
I'm not a pedant but with readied actions it's very specifically says be clear and
it could come back and bite you in the bum. Ok, you, Sasha, see one of the
other people gets their stuff together and also darts out of the doorway at the
far end. You then see a third one, a one who is a bit better dressed, I should
describe all of them once I've described this, also darts to the stairway. You
recognise all of them I should spell out.
#### LYDIA
Oh.
#### ALEX
One of them is one of the ones who got away from Edison's house.
#### LYDIA
Right.
#### ALEX
The second one is also one who got away from Edison's house and a third one
it's a face that you've seen in Other London you do not know them personally,
they are not important to you.
#### LYDIA
Oh right.
#### ALEX
But it's almost certain that this guy just fell in with this crowd at some point in
the past.
#### LYDIA
Oh ok.
#### ALEX
You don't even know their name but it is a face that is familiar to you. The one
who you will remember was referred to as Guy back at Edison's, they said Guy
was away, is a gentleman, very, very limber looking, seems better dressed than
the others. Not poshly dressed by any means but seems to be wearing
potentially Upper London garb, nothing opulent though.
#### LYDIA
Garb?
#### ALEX
Hmm-mm long brunette hair and a goatee.
#### JAMES
Evil. Clearly evil.
#### BEN
Someone has seen a drawing of an evil person, and thought I'm going to be a
villain.
#### JAMES
He has also got a moustache and eyepatch and a British accent.
#### ALEX
I'm afraid not.
#### JAMES
Is he played by Malcolm McDowell?
#### ALEX
We'll have to wait and find out.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### ALEX
Also the other one who you saw dash you only caught the tail end of the one
who had already moved before you so you didn't see who that was.
#### LYDIA
Ok.
#### ALEX
The other you recognise as the one who you were chasing through the
basements.
#### LYDIA
Ah.
#### ALEX
Yeah short hair and wearing just non-descript Other London garbs at this point.
They do however appear to have grabbed belts and so on that were beside
them on chairs as they were dashing out so they are probably equipping
themselves on the fly.
#### LYDIA
So they've gone out that way?
#### ALEX
Indeed they've gone out the opposite side of the church to the bit that you're
hanging off.
#### LYDIA
Can I, do I have time to whisper “they're coming” to the others?
#### BRYN
Not whisper you're up a...
#### LYDIA
Well I can shout, right, “they're on their way”.
#### ALEX
And next up it's Bertie, you are up.
#### JAMES
Super ok so the door, the front door of the building is locked, unlocked?
#### LYDIA
Locked.
#### ALEX
It is currently locked.
#### JAMES
Cool.
#### BRYN
Charge it.
#### JAMES
Can I charge the door and then barge through it and then just attack the first
person I see in a heroic.
#### ALEX
You can barge through the door you can't barge through and attack the
people.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### BRYN
You probably need to attack the door to open it.
#### JAMES
Doors you say, inanimate objects, brilliant. Right I charge the door really hard.
#### BRYN
Power attack!
#### JAMES
Power attack, I power attack the door.
#### ALEX
Power attack the door go for it. So you roll your D20 to hit.
#### JAMES
Fifteen plus.
#### ALEX
Fifteen it's a door so it's...
#### JAMES
Yeah!
#### ALEX
Sorry it's quite literally the size of a barn door as well so you're effectively
rolling to hit the side of a barn and have passed.
#### JAMES
(Laughter).
#### ALEX
If you take your minus one because you're doing a power attack.
#### BRYN
Well you get a plus two for the charge.
#### JAMES
Yeah.
#### ALEX
So you get plus two.
#### JAMES
Straight into a barn door!
#### ALEX
Yep so in total you're definitely hitting.
#### JAMES
Right.
#### ALEX
So roll your damage.
#### JAMES
Which is D10 plus three and that's a D10.
#### BRYN
So you'll do plus five because of the power attack.
#### JAMES
Ooh lovely.
#### BRYN
Instead of plus three.
#### JAMES
Seven, twelve. Twelve, I've twelve.
#### ALEX
Twelve, Bertie with his weapon and shield already in place actually described
how you'll charge, how you'll attack, whether you barge it with your shield
which I'd allow, would you attack with the sword, what would you do?
#### JAMES
A combination of shield and a hack with the sword at the same time and face
first.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
With an almighty bellow, how dare you defy me, door!
#### ALEX
So effectively what you're doing is swinging your left arm wildly, swinging your
right arm wildly and going (screaming)!
#### JAMES
Roaaaaarrrrr!
#### ALEX
Yeah you successfully slam into the door bit of stuff and mortar drop, Sasha
almost needs to make a reflex save not to fall from the impact but nonetheless
you burst through the door and it swings open. What you see are the far side
of the church coming down a stairway, like an open stairway, you see one of
the party who is, yeah, just non-descript urban clothing for Other London. I
will add it to the map in a second.
#### JAMES
Not the swish one?
#### ALEX
Not the swish one.
#### JAMES
Ok cool.
#### ALEX
It's the first one that Sasha didn't really catch a good glimpse of but recognise
sort of as Other London-y. You see a set of pews are kind of haphazardly
arranged, they appear to have been pushed to the side all they are really doing
is giving you difficult cumbersome terrain at the edges.
#### JAMES
Pew pew pew pew pew pew! Yeah, sorry.
#### ALEX
You see the entrance to what you presumes is the steeple.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### ALEX
And him stood in the entrance at the exact opposite end now you've used your
entire turn but there is a clear, straight run from you to him and vice versa. Ok,
next Bryn's readied action goes off. You enter and.
#### BRYN
Slip just behind Bertie and into the corner.
#### ALEX
Well technically actually here's a thing for listeners, when someone moves
through your square you give the, you are required to either allow them to
move through your square or resist them moving through your square because
you're occupying sort of a very narrow space. Will you allow Hamid through or
will you just block him?
#### JAMES
I will allow you through my square.
#### BRYN
Ah, what a gentleman.
#### JAMES
Yes.
#### ALEX
To save time I may go ahead and assume that the party aren't trying to
sabotage each other at every step but do pipe up if you decide that you want
to sabotage. Ok after Bertie, it is Bertie's dog who rolled a natural one, same
as our good old friend Zolf but this natural one was higher because it had a
higher inherent initiative.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
This a dog that is actually drowning in its own spit, he is playing very poor
genetically speaking.
#### ALEX
The dog proceeds to go “ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff”. That's the dog's turn. Zolf you
are up.
#### BEN
Ok cool. Right.
#### BRYN
You could at least double move.
#### BEN
Oh I could yes I am going to, there we go.
#### ALEX
Zolf moves his formidable four squares and is now facing and looking over
Bertie's shoulder into the church.
#### JAMES
He's not looking over my shoulder, looking through my legs.
#### BEN
Well given the elevation of the church as well.
#### ALEX
Oh yeah you are quite literally staring through Bertie's legs.
#### BEN
I have icicles I am going to be firing them through your thighs.
#### ALEX
Ok now.
#### LYDIA
Now the space between his thighs then just through his flesh.
#### BEN
It depends how accurate...
#### ALEX
We'll see how they roll. So the person who came downstairs appears to be
wielding a shortsword, without further ado charges straight at Bertie.
#### JAMES
Bonk.
#### ALEX
Yep and gives an attack on Bertie, there was no difficult terrain, the difficult
terrain is to either side.
#### BRYN
No!
#### ALEX
Ooh rolls a nineteen. I'm going to double check the stats but I know it will be a
hit.
#### BRYN
If he's having a charge action he gets a plus two.
#### ALEX
It's definitely a hit, I'm trying to check what the critical range is.
#### LYDIA
No.
#### ALEX
It is critical.
#### BERTIE
Gah.
#### BRYN
He's got to confirm the critical.
#### ALEX
Yes that's very true (rolls dice) and does not.
#### BERTIE
Hooray.
#### ALEX
So it's just a normal hit.
#### JAMES
Phew!
#### BRYN
That would have been an exciting start to the fight.
#### ALEX
And deals one damage to Bertie.
#### JAMES
Oh that's quite a nuisance I think he might have accidentally like shaved like
quite a nice little just like a little dash in my eyebrow so it looks like I'm now
from the 1990s. He sent you forward in the future.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
That's the entire move.
#### LYDIA
Only his eyebrow.
#### JAMES
Only my eyebrow.
#### ALEX
Sasha.
#### LYDIA
Right well now because they didn't wait for people to come out I'm stuck to
the side of a building.
#### ALEX
You could fit through the window if you chose.
#### LYDIA
Yeah I'm thinking that it would be the most fun for me to climb up, come
round the top and then try and sneak up on people around the back.
#### BEN
Like a true rogue.
#### BRYN
Absolutely.
#### ALEX
Good rogueing. That's fine we will.
#### LYDIA
What do I need to roll?
#### ALEX
Let's skip the acrobatics check because it's a large church window and you are
very good at what you do, that's fine. So you enter into the upper floor, I will
say for the sake of ease you will be able to get right behind the people who are
still in the stairwell.
#### LYDIA
Ok cool.
#### ALEX
And that will be a whole turn just to speed things up.
#### LYDIA
Oh ok so no stabbing?
#### ALEX
Honestly you wouldn't want to anyway, tactically, because...
#### LYDIA
Right they can't see me though?
#### ALEX
But they have no idea you're there.
#### LYDIA
Ok cool.
#### BRYN
It's the thing that happened in the market, if you stabbed them now you'd end
up in a one on one fight.
#### LYDIA
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
#### BRYN
But what you want is to be at the back of a group fight just stabbing them up.
#### ALEX
Yeah I'm throwing you a bit of a bone.
#### LYDIA
And how narrow is this stairwell because...?
#### ALEX
It is a spiral staircase with narrow.
#### LYDIA
So if they are going down and I start stabbing them in the back I think they
should remain, it should remain a flanking move because they cannot turn
around.
#### BEN
And also historically it is easier to fight, you know...
#### ALEX
You did spell out that Sasha was right handed.
#### EVERYONE
Hmmm.
#### ALEX
But either way you are directly behind them, they do not know you are there.
#### LYDIA
(Whispering) Like a shadow, spooky shadow.
#### JAMES
Sorry to be a pedant, which is a phrase you'll almost never hear me say, but if
it's a spiral staircase and Sasha is right handed does the spiral staircase spiral
down anti-clockwise?
#### ALEX
Here's a fun fact for you, all spiral staircases spiral in such a way that the
person who is higher on the spiral staircase has free use of their right arm so
that the defender always has the advantage and that was why knights were
always right handed and not left handed. If you were a left handed knight you
couldn't be a knight, but obviously there were a lot of left handed knights they
just would only fight with their right hand sword.
#### JAMES
That's interesting I did not know that.
#### BRYN
It was a tactical decision for castles and stuff.
#### ALEX
I even then went to a castle and checked it out, totally real, totally a thing.
#### LYDIA
I think there's a big plaque in Corfe Castle that explained this.
#### ALEX
It's really useful. So after Sasha it's Hamid.
#### BRYN
I'm quite upset, I'm standing next to Bertie which I am a fan of but there's a
guy literally right next to me as well, an enemy with a weapon.
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### BRYN
And that is not where I like to be in a fight.
#### BEN
You are an un-fan of that.
#### BRYN
Yes, I am going to drop my crossbow, my crossbow is on a strap so when I say
drop it sort of falls to my thigh rather than to the floor.
#### ALEX
Yeah and for listeners, we have had this discussion ahead of like character
creation he isn't just inventing this stuff on the fly.
#### BRYN
As an experienced LARP-er I have done this for real as well, the strap is very
useful.
#### BEN
The strap is good.
#### BRYN
Because I am then going to cast a spell but the thing is, is when I cast a spell I
can cast defensively which means I can potentially avoid the attack of
opportunity.
#### ALEX
Because when it comes to casting most spells would present an attack
opportunity where the person sees that you're trying to cast a spell and gets a
quick jab in, doing it defensively boosts.
#### BRYN
Well I have to pass my concentration check.
#### ALEX
If he passes his concentration check it boosts his defence against their attack.
#### BRYN
And that's why in the first scene we took the other boring feat of combat
casting. I roll one.
#### LYDIA
This is becoming a habit for us.
#### BRYN
Almost certainly doesn't work.
#### ALEX
Well Hamid is still learning not to panic in the moment.
#### BRYN
Yes.
#### ALEX
So you fail your concentration check, are you still able to cast?
#### BRYN
I still get to cast but he gets an attack opportunity and if I take damage I have
to make another concentration check for my spell not to explode.
#### ALEX
Correct.
#### BRYN
In my face.
#### ALEX
Spoilers, he'll take the attack of opportunity, Bryn.
#### BRYN
Well, doy.
#### ALEX
What's your AC?
#### BRYN
Thirteen.
#### ALEX
It will be a hit I believe.
#### BRYN
Of course it will. Why am I standing next to an enemy?
#### LYDIA
Because Hamid wants to be a hero and you role play well.
#### ALEX
So what spell were you going to cast?
#### BRYN
Magic missile.
#### ALEX
And deals almost the highest he can roll of five.
#### BRYN
Five damage.
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### BRYN
It's cool, I've got loads of hit points now.
#### ALEX
Oh you rested, you slept and all of the things.
#### BRYN
Right so I must make a concentration check where DC equals a ten plus the
damage taken plus the level of the spell I'm casting.
#### JAMES
Fifteen, sixteen?
#### BRYN
Yeah and my combat casting doesn't help with this because it's only for the
first one.
#### ALEX
No, yeah.
#### BEN
Oh just roll over a sixteen. No.
#### BRYN
Seven.
#### ALEX
So the spell fails.
#### BRYN
The spell fails.
#### ALEX
Yep.
#### LYDIA
Does it explode and do you damage? Just when you said explode in your face I
didn't know if that was a thing that actually happens?
#### ALEX
Certain types of spell failure can explode in your face. A lot of it depends on
the type of spell.
#### BRYN
Normally it's if you roll really badly.
#### ALEX
Like if they were to roll cripplingly terribly there is a whole set of tables which I
will make use of at some point which lists, there's a hundred options, option
hundred is what is the worst thing that you can imagine, GM, that happens.
Some of them are a limb just disappears never to return. Your face is...
#### BRYN
Been there, done that.
#### ALEX
Your mouth seals up like there are loads of different tables for spell failures
depending on the spells if you want to play it properly you know very hardcore
with the rules, in this case frankly the failures weren't bad enough and
especially for a simple magic missile not really. So I'm afraid Hamid's spell fails,
the attack of opportunity happened. Then the friend of the one who has just
slashed Hamid makes it down the stairs. Now he can't charge Bertie because
he'd be charging through his friend and similarly he can't really get an attack
on without necessarily hurting his friend. So what he will do is he will step to
the entrance of the steeply and draw a very familiar looking flask for everyone.
So after him is the swanky fella. The swanky fella makes it down the stairs to
the doorway, takes stock of the situation and then casts a spell.
#### LYDIA
Is there space for me to have an attack of opportunity while he tries to cast a
spell since I'm directly behind him?
#### ALEX
You are able to take the attack of opportunity as he moves down the stairs but
he would then become aware of you on the stairs. If you'd like to do that
though that's fine.
#### LYDIA
I think I would, I think I would like to stab.
#### ALEX
Do it honestly, don't hesitate, just roll.
#### JAMES
I must stab.
#### LYDIA
She's got fourteen daggers.
(Group laughter).
#### ALEX
So retcon, he is starting to move down the stairs and you go for the attack
opportunity that's absolutely fine. Ooh.
#### LYDIA
That's a critical yeah.
#### ALEX
Roll to confirm.
#### LYDIA
What do you, what?
#### ALEX
So you have to do another attack roll and if your second attack roll hits that
counts as a critical.
#### LYDIA
Ok, I know it will be a one, I know it.
#### BRYN
But it will still be a hit regardless.
#### LYDIA
Oh no.
#### BRYN
No, no doesn't that keep going or is that a...
#### JAMES
That's a potential house rule.
#### BRYN
Oh she just rolled a twenty by the way.
#### LYDIA
So I rolled a twenty.
#### ALEX
Oooh now I may opening very dangerous territory, what I'm going to say is I
won't allow criticals to stack.
#### BRYN
That's fair enough.
#### ALEX
Less because I want to impede you guys but you will encounter monsters.
#### BRYN
More because they will kill us.
#### ALEX
Who are specifically designed to crit again and again and again because they'll
have a massive range and I do not want you guys to face a monster at some
point who is obeying the same rules as you who will one shot every single one
of you, it will happen.
#### BRYN
I think that's a good decision.
#### BEN
It becomes a zero sum game really.
#### ALEX
What I will do however is because it's a natural twenty I may chuck in a little
contextual effect like him tripping up or something.
#### BEN
If he survives.
#### ALEX
Very true.
#### BEN
That's with sneak attack as well.
#### LYDIA
Yeah.
#### BRYN
So you get 2D4 and 2D6 damage in total.
#### ALEX
Including crit and to clarify, now imagine if you were doing this with your extra
sneak like it stacks it gets quite high quite quickly.
#### BRYN
Roll it together.
#### LYDIA
Roll them together?
#### BRYN
Everything.
#### LYDIA
Ok, ok so that's a three and a two, five, and a three and a one, four so nine
damage.
#### ALEX
Mine the one oh no, no, yeah so that's nine total.
#### LYDIA
Yeah do my D4s get minus ones?
#### BRYN
They don't because you're, but the D6s get plus ones.
#### LYDIA
Ah right.
#### ALEX
So it all balanced out this time.
#### LYDIA
Cool.
#### ALEX
So...
#### LYDIA
Stabbing is fun.
#### ALEX
Ooh that was a big hit from Sasha.
#### LYDIA
I like stabbing.
#### ALEX
And only on the one attack.
#### LYDIA
I do like stabbing, it's the best. Quiet stabbing.
#### BEN
When he's as squishy as Hamid he's going to be hurting.
#### ALEX
So yeah you get a formidable hit, a really hard hit on the guy.
#### LYDIA
Right in his...
#### JAMES
Right in the kidney.
#### LYDIA
Right in his back.
#### ALEX
He is not happy at all and he will in fact tumble down the stairs and end up
prone at the entrance.
#### BRYN
Ah brilliant.
#### ALEX
I wouldn't normally do that but I feel like with a natural twenty I'd like to
reward it in some way.
#### LYDIA
Since we did manage in the last, in the combat before last to roll what was it
four ones in a row and suffer for that I think it's at least, I think it makes sense.
#### BEN
Vindication.
#### LYDIA
Yeah it feels like a fair GM-ing.
#### ALEX
Because it's in your favour.
#### LYDIA
Yeah. To be fair I don't... I mean I complained a bit but, you know.
#### ALEX
Ok so yeah he isn't going to be able to cast, certainly not while prone, he's still
too busy trying to figure what the heck just happened. Moving onto Bertie.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### BRYN
Kill him, please kill him.
#### JAMES
He's just going to swing his mighty sword.
#### BRYN
Before he kills me.
#### JAMES
And attack the chap who is directly in front of him who just slashed at Hamid.
#### BRYN
Are you power attacking him?
#### JAMES
I, I might do actually because I've got weapon focus bastard sword which
would counteract the minus one?
#### BRYN
Well so your normal attack bonus is six, if you power attack it will be an attack
bonus of five.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### BRYN
So I mean it's only one and... it's up to you.
#### ALEX
Power attacks are deliberately weighted in such a way that if you take the
negative to hit you're getting more in the pay-off for damage so it depends, it
depends what your goal is.
#### JAMES
Yeah let's do it, Bertie's... he's crashed through the door, it has gone splintering
all over the side, he is surrounded by wooden shards his nemesis the door
vanquished, laying in pieces around him, barely a matchstick, it has been
fragmented into sawdust. This creepy little fellow was charged all the way
across him and gently shaved one of his eyebrows.
(Group laughter)
#### JAMES
Hamid appears to have fallen over his own face.
(Group laughter)
#### BRYN
True story.
#### JAMES
Punished for his ineptitude, the savage slashing to his tiny little body. Outraged
Bertie let's out a mighty bellow of “That is very rude,” hefts his bastard sword
mightily in the air and brings it crashing towards this greasy little oik in front of
him.
#### ALEX
Very good.
#### BEN
You'd make an excellent nanny.
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
Give me the roll and let's see if this child gets punished.
#### JAMES
Twenty.
#### EVERYBODY
(Cheering)
#### ALEX
Give me another roll to see if he confirms.
#### JAMES
Fifteen.
#### BRYN
Plus attack five.
#### ALEX
Yes it's confirmed.
#### BEN
Ooh that was confirmed critical a power attack. We're a party of either it goes
amazingly or it just goes terribly.
#### BRYN
You will get 2D10.
#### JAMES
Ok.
#### BRYN
Plus ten.
#### JAMES
2D10 plus 10. In a minute I want you to describe for me what the consequence
is because I would like to decide what happens in...
#### ALEX
Very much, very much.
#### JAMES
Seven is that a ten?
#### ALEX
That's a ten.
#### JAMES
Seventeen.
#### ALEX
Plus ten?
#### JAMES
Yeah twenty seven.
#### ALEX
So twenty seven at level two.
#### LYDIA
Oh his organs!
#### ALEX
Twenty... ok.
#### JAMES
The organs, the organs. Is he definitely dead?
#### ALEX
You powered him through all of his health, all of his negatives, like, with let me
do the maths actually with more than five damage is just floating around spare
because he's already dead and you're still doing it.
#### BRYN
You've literally bisected him.
#### BEN
Yeah so when you said I'll bisect that guy in the alley and we said no because
there's extra health for them to be dead, dead, dead now I'd like to.
#### ALEX
Genuinely like you've powered through that no one who was in this scenario
could have possibly survived that. Yeah honestly, go nuts there's no worse you
could do to a person.
#### LYDIA
Awww.
#### JAMES
Bertie slices him neatly in half, perfect incision straight from forehead to parts
that cannot be mentioned in a family podcast.
#### BRYN
Groin.
#### JAMES
Groin, groin-al region, his left side flops into the central alleyway of the church,
the right flops over one of the pews bouncing as it hits the other side and just
leaking. Bertie goes, “Manners young man, manners”.
(Group laughter)
#### BEN
I told you, excellent nanny.
#### BRYN
Hamid vomits.
#### ALEX
This is perfectly natural, you see a pink mist and proceed to vomit. So there's
definitely a good place to just end the episode. I realise that there's still a bit
of a turn left but neatly finely bisecting someone is not something you.
#### JAMES
Yeah achievement unlocked.
(Group laughter).
#### ALEX
So wow, ok, we'll be jumping back into combat at the start of the next episode
but that... that escalated quickly.
#### ALEX
Yeah we'll just remove that and cleft that miniature in twain. So...
#### JAMES
We won't, Erin, we won't air it, it's safe, it's fine.
#### ALEX
Erin, we promise we love them very much we polish them but not in a
damaging polish. So I guess that's goodbye from everyone and we look
forward to seeing you next week.
#### EVERYONE
Bye!

#### ALEX
Ben, you're fine. Bryn?
#### BRYN
Hello, how are you, Alex?
#### ALEX
Keep going.
#### BRYN
It's nice to see you again. Are you doing something new with your hair? You're
looking well, by which I mean fat.
#### ALEX
Keep going.
(Group laughter)
#### BRYN
Oh really, you want more of this, do you?
#### ALEX
Keep going.
(Chewing noises)
#### LYDIA
Oh god, I really hope I never have to hear that on the recording.
#### ALEX
I had to do one where he gulped, he went (gulps). It was the most foul thing...
(Group laughter)
#### ALEX
I've heard in my entire life. It was halfway between a tsunami and a courtesy
flush.
(Group laughter and groaning)
